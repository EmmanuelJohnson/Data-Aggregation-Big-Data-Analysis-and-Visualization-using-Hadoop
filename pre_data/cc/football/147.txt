There’s an expression about trustworthiness that goes something like this: Would you buy a used car from this man?Well, in its Super Bowl ad, Hyundai is pitching new cars, not used — and the man they think you’d buy one from is Jason Bateman.“For this role, it was always Jason Bateman,” ad exec Barney Goldberg said in a statement. “It had to be him.”Bateman is the straight-man star of the cult-classic sitcom Arrested Development and movies such as Horrible Bosses and Game Night.“Jason is really the only person that could pull off humor like this while staying so likeable,” added Goldberg, executive creative director of Innocean USA.Likeability is part of the Bateman brand. Or as The Guardian once put it: “Like most of the characters he has played, Bateman can get away with saying terrible things but still be incredibly likeable.”The 60-second Super Bowl spot will run in the first quarter and is centered on the Hyundai Shopper Assurance program, which the company says modernizes car buying by making it more digital and convenient.More: Luke Wilson to star in unique Super Bowl ad as Colgate gets into the gameMore: Anheuser-Busch 'to bet even bigger' with Super Bowl LIII ad buy“Jason Bateman is the perfect person to infuse humor into this year’s Super Bowl ad and help us communicate the universal truth that people want a better way to shop for and buy a new car,” Dean Evans, chief marketing officer of Hyundai Motor America, said in a statement.Hyundai ran an emotional ad in last year’s Super Bowl featuring its Hope on Wheels program benefiting pediatric cancer research. The year before Hyundai worked with the U.S. Department of Defense and filmed a spot during the game at NRG Stadium in Houston and at a U.S. military base in Poland. Bateman will appear in his first Super Bowl commercial, though not his first commercial: He was in an ad for Honey Nut Cheerios during his days as a child star.“It was fun, and they said I was good at it,” Bateman told the Chicago Tribune in 1994. “Anything they tell you you’re good at as a kid, you like to do as an adult.”
