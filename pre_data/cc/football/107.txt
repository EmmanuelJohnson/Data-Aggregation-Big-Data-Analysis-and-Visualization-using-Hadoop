KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — Chiefs coach Andy Reid was summoned to the corner of Arrowhead Stadium during Saturday's playoff game against the Indianapolis Colts to get fans to stop throwing snowballs on the field.Reid wasn't happy about it, either.The officials called him over from the Kansas City sideline during the two-minute warning in the first half, and Reid shouted and gestured at the fans in the lower deck — though the snowballs were mostly raining down from the upper deck, far above the field.Earlier in the half, one almost hit Colts punter Rigoberto Sanchez during a kick.Reid's intervention didn't do much good, either. Patrick Mahomes scampered in moments later to give the Colts a 24-7 lead, and snowballs fell like confetti from the upper deck.___More AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL
