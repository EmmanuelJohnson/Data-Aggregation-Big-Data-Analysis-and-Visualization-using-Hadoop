Anheuser-Busch figures to be the biggest advertiser in Super Bowl LIII with a mighty 5-½ minutes of airtime.“We’re making a very bold decision,” Marcel Marcondes, A-B’s U.S. chief marketing officer, told USA TODAY Sports. “We have decided to bet even bigger behind the Super Bowl.”A-B has decades of history in Super Bowl advertising but most likely never as big a buy as this."We didn’t go back in the files, but this is probably the largest airtime ever that we are going to have as a company,” Marcondes said. “So we have really great room to bring to life a lot of our brands.”The A-B brands with spots are Budweiser and Budweiser Reserve Copper Lager with one each; Bud Light with two; Michelob ULTRA and Michelob ULTRA Pure Gold with one each; Stella Artois with one; and BON + VIV Spiked Seltzer with one.More: NFL playoff X factors: Eight things that could swing divisional-round gamesMore: What's next for four teams eliminated in NFL playoffs' wild-card round?Marcondes said he couldn’t talk yet about the creative aspects of the ads but said they will deliver on three strategic priorities — quality, premiumization and innovation."We’re going to have Bud and Bud Light addressing quality,” Marcondes said. “We’re going to have Michelob ULTRA and Stella Artois addressing premiumization because consumers are trading up in beer. And we’re going to have some first-timers on Super Bowl (Copper Lager, Pure Gold and Spiked Seltzer) because we want to drive innovation.”A-B’s buy includes four 45-second ads, three 30-second ads and one 60-second ad. Super Bowl ads are expected to cost somewhere north of $5 million per 30 seconds, but Marcondes declined to say what A-B is paying for all that inventory."Unfortunately I can’t get into details on that, but it is a meaningful investment,” he said. “We treat this as a very big moment on the calendar. It is a unique opportunity to talk to people, to engage with people … and we can set the tone for rest of the year.”
