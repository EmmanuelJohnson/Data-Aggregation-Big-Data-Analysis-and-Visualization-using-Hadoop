Former Stanford tailback Bryce Love is recovering from surgery last month for a torn anterior cruciate ligament suffered in his final game with the Cardinal. The draft hopeful expects the injury won’t prevent him from making a limited participation appearance at the NFL combine in February.Love disclosed the injury to Yahoo Sports on Friday, noting that he expects to make a full recovery“Obviously, there’s no such thing as an idea injury, but I’m on the path to recovery, and my goal remains the same – getting drafted by an NFL team and being the ultimate professional,” Love told Yahoo. “I’ll be back better than I’ve ever been before.”Love was injured in Stanford’s 23-13 win over Cal in the season finale on Dec. 1. He missed the Cardinal's game against Pittsburgh in the Sun Bowl. Dr. James Andrews performed his surgery.      Love ran for only 739 yards as a senior, but NFL scouts won’t forget that he rushed for 2,118 yards as a junior when he finished runner-up in the Heisman Trophy voting behind Baker Mayfield.It was considered a surprise when Love decided to come back for his senior season. One reason why he came back for his senior season was to complete a degree in biology. He has aspirations of being a pediatrician, according to Yahoo. At one point, ESPN’s Mel Kiper had Love listed as the No. 2 running back., but Love stock dropped this season as his production fell on a team that was overrun by injuries on the offensive line.
