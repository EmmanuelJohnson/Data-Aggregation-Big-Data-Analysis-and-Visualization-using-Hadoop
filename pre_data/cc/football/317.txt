1. Patriots (7): What's left to say? Definitively the greatest dynasty in NFL history, even on heels of subpar (by their standards) regular season. Now in a race with Pittsburgh to be first seven-time Super Bowl champions.2. Saints (1):They got shafted. Period. In retrospect (or forespect?), who wouldn't have preferred a New England-New Orleans, Brady-Brees Super Bowl LIII?3. Chiefs (4): They've also got strong argument for finishing second in final 2018 power rankings poll after taking eventual champs to OT in AFC title game.4. Rams (3): Great season. But Super Bowl flop, Todd Gurley mystery, Jared Goff's postseason struggles, non-call in New Orleans deservedly knock them down.5. Chargers (6): Could best Bolts team in recent memory be even better in 2019 with full seasons out of DE Joey Bosa and TE Hunter Henry?6. Colts (8): GM Chris Ballard has most cap space in NFL (more than $100 million projected) and three of draft's top 58 picks. AFC darlings in 2019.7. Bears (2): Magical season under rookie coach Matt Nagy. But can GM Ryan Pace improve roster with little cap space and no draft pick before Round 3?8. Cowboys (11): They've never sustained momentum under Jason Garrett, whose contract looms as issue. Ditto Demarcus Lawrence. And, apparently, Zeke Elliott.9. Eagles (12): Will they be better or not with Carson Wentz at controls for playoff run? What will presumed trade of Nick Foles do for roster enhancement?10. Seahawks (9): Rebuild/reboot phase over for team that appeared way ahead of schedule in 2018. Decisions loom for unsigned Frank Clark and Earl Thomas.Super takeaways: 53 things we learned from Patriots' 13-3 win over Rams in Super Bowl LIIIMock draft: Do Patriots take Brady's successor?Lookahead: 10 biggest questions for the 2019 NFL offseason11. Vikings (15): With year in Minnesota under his belt and salary cap airtight, it's completely fair to weigh wisdom of Kirk Cousins deal moving forward.12. Ravens (5): Eric DeCosta regime off to awkward start with new GM answering John Harbaugh questions. Bigger worry? Lamar Jackson's playoff disaster.13. Browns (14):ESPN's dysfunction exposé fascinated. Regardless, they appear playoff-primed — especially after wisely sticking with Freddie Kitchens.14. Texans (10):Quiet playoff exit didn't dispel notion they feasted on soft schedule. Will chunk of ample cap space go toward new Jadeveon Clowney deal?15. Falcons (16): Groundhog Day? Talented core should remain largely intact, but can new/former OC Dirk Koetter get more from offense than Steve Sarkisian?16. 49ers (21): Jimmy Garoppolo, Jerick McKinnon return to club that unfailingly fought despite dim prospects. No. 2 pick, $60M for free agents only help.17. Steelers (13): Head start on locker room drama in 2019 with Antonio Brown conundrum continuing to unfold as social media serial with trade window nearing.18. Buccaneers (29): If Bruce Arians can harness Jameis Winston's ability and Todd Bowles can ignite defense, these could be your 2019 playoff dark horses.19. Packers (18): They jump gun hiring HC Matt LaFleur for 2019? McVay protégé has extremely high bar to earn Aaron Rodgers' trust, spark proud franchise.20. Titans (17): They jump gun hiring OC Matt LaFleur for 2018? Arthur Smith becomes Marcus Mariota's fifth play caller after 25th-ranked unit disappointed.21. Panthers (20): Is 1-7 second half easily explained away by Cam Newton's bum shoulder, or is a more serious issue afoot? Several prominent vets not returning.22. Jaguars (27): No team underachieved more in 2018 — meaning none likely has more potential for 2019 rebound. Question, of course: Who's taking the snaps?23. Jets (24): New HC Adam Gase inherits QB Sam Darnold, draft's third overall pick and $90 million in cap space. Is young team finally cleared for takeoff?24. Raiders (23): So many holes. So many questions. Yet so much capital. New GM Mike Mayock owns four of draft's top 36 picks plus $70 million under cap.25. Giants (19): Whither Eli Manning? Is there really a franchise QB in this draft, and would Eli be a willing mentor? Or is team better off pursuing a vet?26. Broncos (26): Nice to see Vic Fangio earn HC opportunity. But given offense is primary issue in Denver, was hire of Rich Scangarello to run it a good one?27. Bills (22): Defense quietly finished ranked second in league. Sean McDermott deserves more credit for squeezing six wins out of talent-deficient roster.28. Bengals (25): What Cincy fans must've thought as their new boss, erstwhile Rams QB coach Zac Taylor, failed to get Goff on track in Super Bowl.29. Lions (28): Matt Patricia's players didn't respond on field, and he didn't respond to adversity very well away from it. Hot seat will be pre-warmed in 2019.30. Cardinals (30): Kliff Kingsbury inherits team with potential for quick-ish turnaround, but his dearth of pro experience could be impediment to early success.31. Dolphins (32): Brian Flores next up in trying to prove some apples don't fall far from Belichick tree. Unfortunately, not many seeds in Miami orchard.32. Redskins (31): Given how they collapsed without Alex Smith and likely won't have Adrian Peterson back, 2019 already has potential as dismal campaign.***Follow Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis.
