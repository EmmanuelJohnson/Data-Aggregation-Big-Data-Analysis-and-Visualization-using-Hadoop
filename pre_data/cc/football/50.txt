CHICAGO (AP) â€” Kicker Cody Parkey is staying off social medial after his missed field goal at the end of the Chicago Bears' 16-15 wild-card loss to the Philadelphia Eagles.Parkey told NBC's "Today" show Friday he feels "worse than anybody about missing that kick." He also says "football is what I do; it's not who I am."The Bears won the NFC North in their first season under coach Matt Nagy after four straight last-place finishes. Parkey thought he hit a "pretty good kick" and his 43-yard attempt would go in even as it hit the left upright and crossbar. He wasn't aware Philadelphia's Treyvon Hester touched it.Parkey also expressed appreciation for his teammates' support.___More AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL
