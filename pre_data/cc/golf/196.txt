Schenk finished the second round 1-over 71 with four birdies and two other bogeys on the fifth and sixth holes.Golf's new rules, which include the one Schenk and his caddie were judged to have violated, have been criticized by fans and players since they went into effect Jan. 1.Justin Thomas, who finished the third round at the Honda Classic 3-under 67, came to Schenk's defense on Twitter shortly after the infraction was announced Saturday.In January Haotong Li became the first player penalized under the new rule regarding caddies and alignment. He was hit with a two-shot penalty at the Dubai Desert Classic when his caddie was ruled to have been standing behind him while Li was putting on the 18th green in the final round. European Tour chief Keith Pelley called the rule "grossly unfair" at the time.One of the most well-known challengers to the new rules is Rickie Fowler, who was penalized one stroke for violating the knee-high drop rule during last week's WGC-Mexico Championship.A photo was taken of Fowler mocking the rule Thursday at the Honda Classic as he squat down, held the golf ball behind his back and joking asked an official if he was following the new rule correctly.1.9% BODY FAT?!?: NFL prospect's ridiculous physique goes viralSHIRTLESS GOLFER: Drew Nesbitt makes par after shot from water hazardFOWLER'S FOUL?: Golfer challenges new PGA Tour drop rulesÂ
