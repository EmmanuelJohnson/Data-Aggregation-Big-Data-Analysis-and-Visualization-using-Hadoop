PACIFIC PALISADES, Calif. - As players increasingly turn to stat gurus to tell them about past performance at courses, Tiger Woods said he's less about deep stat dives and more about scoreboard watching. Particularly when he has an afternoon time as he does in round one of the Genesis Open."By the time I start off in the afternoon, most guys are done between 7 to 13, 14 holes and I like to get kind of a feel how it's playing," Woods said when asked if he'd looked to past stats to figure out why he has been winless at Riviera Country Club."Taking a look at that and understanding that, when I go out on the course in my afternoon session, I have an understanding of what some of the tricks or some of the things that I might be able to take advantage of and also where I need to play defense. I think that's very important."READ MORE: Get the latest golf news and analysis at GolfweekUP NEXT: Tiger officially headed to WGC-Mexico ChampionshipWhile Woods still jokes about his one legitimate chance to win here in the 1999 event, he has posted his share of 65s and a 64 at Riviera.
