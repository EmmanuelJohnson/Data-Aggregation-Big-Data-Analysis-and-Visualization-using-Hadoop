SAN FRANCISCO (AP) â€” The PGA Tour has pulled the plug on a new tournament hosted by Stephen Curry with time running short and details ranging from the golf course to sponsorship that could not be pulled together."Due to a combination of factors, we are unable to bring a proposed event to San Francisco at this time," the tour said Tuesday in a statement.The San Francisco Chronicle first reported the development, and Curry told the newspaper he isn't giving up on the idea."We are still committed to bringing an event to San Francisco," Curry said. "It just won't be this year."The Chronicle said talks with Pleasanton-based Workday, a finance and human resources software company that has endorsement deals with some PGA Tour players, unexpectedly broke off. Curry's tournament was to be played Sept. 19-22, but it still didn't have a tournament director and there were concerns that work to Lake Merced Golf Club could not be completed in time.Members at Lake Merced, which hosts an LPGA Tour stop in May, had approved spending more than $3.6 million on upgrades."The bottom line is the short timeframe for creating an event in early fall of 2019 created the biggest obstacle," the tour said.The Golden State Warriors guard has played in a Web.com Tour event the last two years, missing the cut both times. Curry was not planning to play in the PGA Tour event he was to host.___More AP golf: https://apnews.com/apf-Golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
