What is with San Antonio's basketball arena and bats?In 2009, Manu Ginobili (on Halloween, no less) famously swatted a bat out of the air with his bare hand during a home game against the Sacramento Kings.Then Thursday, a game against the Brooklyn Nets was disrupted for nearly three minutes in the first quarter at AT&T Center when three bats began swooping around the court. Arena staff did its best to catch them, but play was resumed when the bats flew back to the rafters.Saturday, the Spurs were ready for a return of the flying mammals.Their mascot, The Coyote, was patrolling with a net when a bat appeared early in the first quarter against the New Orleans Pelicans.AD UPDATE: Anthony Davis' dad 'would never want my son to play for Boston'THE STREAK: James Harden gets his 30 points with acrobatic late 3-pointerAnd though coyotes traditionally have terrible luck with roadrunners, this mascot did eventually best the bat.Maybe it helped that The Coyote was wearing a Batman T-shirt, mask and cape, but he finally got the bat in his net with a diving attempt.Arena staff then was able to remove the bat with a towel.Perhaps, the bats will start getting the message.
