"I think to check that box and for the team to play well and execute is good. We'll move on."The Bucks are soaring, thanks mostly to the 6-foot-11, 242-pound Antetokounmpo, who scored 14 on free throws and had two dazzling assists early in the fourth. He first smothered Trae Young to steal the ball and feed George Hill for a 3-pointer that made it 104-90, before adding a no-look drop pass on D.J. Wilson's layup for a 16-point lead.

These are tough jobs, and so I don't know who the right coach is," he said. "And I think they feel great about where they are and that's important for them. They have their direction they know where they're going. I'm obviously very happy with our team, our front office and our roster. I'm very excited about where I am."UP NEXTBucks: Host Miami on Tuesday.Hawks: Host Oklahoma City on Tuesday.___More AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
