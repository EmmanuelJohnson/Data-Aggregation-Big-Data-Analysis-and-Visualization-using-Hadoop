The New York Knicks used a picture featuring Golden State Warriors forward Kevin Durant in a pitch to season-ticket holders, and then deleted it — further fueling the fire surrounding the superstar's upcoming free agency.The photo included Knicks rookie Mitchell Robinson standing next to Durant during a game, and it featured a link for fans to learn more about renewal information for the 2019-20 season."Game action photos are used all the time for marketing purposes, but given everything going on, we took the precaution of taking the photo down," the Knicks said in a statement provided to multiple news outlets. "To be clear, it was one of several rotating photos on the website."This comes a little over a week after the Knicks, who have an NBA-worst 10-45 record, traded away franchise cornerstone Kristaps Porzingis to Dallas, opening up more space to pursue big-name free agents this summer. Last week, Durant ripped the media for speculating about his future and where he may end up."I have nothing to do with the Knicks," Durant said. "I don't know who traded Porzingis. It's got nothing to do with me. I'm trying to play basketball. Ya'll come in here every day, ask me about free agency — ask my teammates, my coaches, you rile up the fans about it. Let us play basketball, that's all I'm saying."
