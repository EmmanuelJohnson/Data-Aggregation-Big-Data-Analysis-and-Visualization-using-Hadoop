Every baseball season produces its share of unexpected success stories – players who may not have had much fanfare entering spring training, but who take the playing time they're given and make the most of it. There are also players who have plenty of raw talent, but haven't quite figured out how to channel it in the proper direction – at least, not yet.Fantasy baseball owners are always on the lookout for the next wave of breakouts and sleepers, so we're doing some digging through the rosters of all 30 MLB teams to find the best candidates at each position for the 2019 season:Breakout: Danny Jansen, Toronto Blue Jays – Heading into spring training atop the depth chart, the 23-year-old posted a .347 OBP in 31 games in the majors last year.Sleeper: Willians Astudillo, Minnesota Twins – His .355 average in 30 games in the majors probably (definitely) isn’t sustainable, but he’s hit at every level and could become one of the league’s top offensive backstops in 2019.Breakout: Cody Bellinger, Los Angeles Dodgers – His home run total (25) was disappointing a year after hitting 39 as a rookie, but his OBP rose while his strikeout rate dropped as the season went on. Expect a bounce-back campaign and a run at 20 steals for the 23-year-old.Sleeper: Jake Bauers, Cleveland Indians – Look past the .201 batting average and you'll find a big power threat who gets on base at a high clip. Should rack of plenty of counting stats in the Cleveland lineup.Breakout: Ozzie Albies, Atlanta Braves – He really fell off in the second half, hitting four home runs after 20 before the break, but chalk that up to a 21-year-old playing his first full big-league season.Sleeper: Joey Wendle, Tampa Bay Rays – At 28, Wendle was an older rookie in 2018 and posted a .321/.381/.486 line with nine steals in the second half.Breakout: Adalberto Mondesi, Kansas City Royals – Finally given a chance, Mondesi – only 23 years old – showed what he can do in 2018, hitting 14 home runs with 32 steals in just 75 games.Sleeper: Amed Rosario, New York Mets – The 23-year-old struggled for much of 2018, but started to put it together down the stretch, batting .284 with 15 steals across August and September.Breakout: Matt Chapman, Oakland Athletics – After taking a huge leap forward in 2018, expect even more from Chapman, who had an enormous second half.Sleeper: Rafael Devers, Boston Red Sox – Boston would have liked to get more from the youngster last year but with some of the hype died down, he should be a great value pick in 2019.Breakout: Andrew Benintendi, Boston Red Sox – Already a 20-steal guy, Benintendi improved across the board as a second-year player in 2018 and could really take his game to the next level this season.Sleeper: Willie Calhoun, Texas Rangers – Calhoun has reportedly lost weight and despite a number of left-handed hitters ahead of him in the Texas pecking order, should force his way into at-bats.Breakout: Jack Flaherty, St. Louis Cardinals – Struck out 182 in 151 innings last season and at 23, looks ready to become one of the game’s top starters.Sleeper: Sean Newcomb, Atlanta Braves – Struggled in the second half but it’s worth noting the improvement in his K/BB ratio – a big deal for a lefty who has struggled with control.Breakout: Jose Alvarado, Tampa Bay Rays – Tampa’s young lefty should get the majority of save opportunities this year after dazzling with 80 strikeouts in 64 innings last season.Sleeper: Ken Giles, Toronto Blue Jays – After a rocky tenure in Houston, Giles is regaining his confidence and should be the man getting the saves in Toronto.
