Holding court with the media upon his arrival to spring training, Tim Tebow explained his decision to pass on joining the new Alliance of American Football league."It was easy – even though it was an awesome offer and it's humbling. I'm all-in on baseball," Tebow said Saturday at the Mets' spring training complex in Port St. Lucie, Fla. "No way could i stop and not give this the chance after everything i've worked for."Tebow will start the season at Class AAA, just one step away from the majors. The 31-year-old hit .273 in Class AA last season, his second full year as a professional baseball player. Steve Spurrier is the head coach of the league's Orlando Apollos and Tebow said the fellow Florida Gators great had been persistent in getting him to play football."They called a lot – and coach Spurrier keeps calling," Tebow said with a laugh. "And I love coach Spurrier."Spurrier said earlier this week that he hadn't taken any addition steps to recruit Tebow since reaching out last year."I think Tim’s probably headed in the baseball direction right now, and I certainly don’t blame him," Spurrier said. "I think if I was in his situation, I might do the same thing."
