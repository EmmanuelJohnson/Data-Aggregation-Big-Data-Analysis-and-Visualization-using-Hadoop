Mookie Betts avoided arbitration with the Boston Red Sox, agreeing to a one-year, $20 million with the team, according to multiple reports.Betts' salary is a new record for a second-year arbitration-eligible player and is a $9.5 million raise from his 2018 paycheck.The 26-year-old led the Red Sox to a championship and won the American League MVP award, batting .346 with 32 homers and won his third consecutive Gold Glove. He also led the majors in runs (129) and slugging percentage (.640).Boston will be inclined to negotiate a long-term extension with their superstar who will become eligible for free agency after the 2020 season, the same winter that Angels center fielder Mike Trout is scheduled to hit the open market. Betts was taken by the Red Sox in the fifth round of the 2011 draft.
