With spring training approaching and top free agents remaining unsigned, it's been an another icy winter for baseball's hot stove.Left-handed pitcher Dallas Keuchel is one of the best players still available and took to Twitter on Thursday night replying to a tweet calling for the New York Yankees to sign him. The tweet cited the 31-year-old's credentials: a 3.66 career ERA, the 2015 AL Cy Young award and a World Series title."That doesn’t mean anything anymore... apparently," Kuechel wrote.Of USA TODAY Sports' top six free agents, five are yet to sign – including superstars Bryce Harper and Manny Machado.Keuchel spent his entire career with the Astros, making his big-league debut in 2012. Since 2014, Keuchel is 67-45 with a 3.28 ERA in 145 starts, with a 3.31 ERA in 51 ⅔ postseason innings.Giants third baseman Evan Longoria added his voice Friday, posting a picture of Keuchel, Kimbrel, Harper and Machado on Instagram with a caption critical of the current situation."We are less then a month from the start of spring and once again some of our games biggest starts remain unsigned. Such a shame. It’s seems every day now someone is making up a new analytical tool to devalue players, especially free agents," Longoria's post said."As fans, why should 'value' for your team even be a consideration? It’s not your money, it’s money that players have worked their whole lives to get to that level and be deserving of. Bottom line, fans should want the best players and product on the field for their team. And as players we need to stand strong for what we believe we are worth and continue to fight for the rights we have fought for time and time again."
