ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) â€” Left-hander Alex Wood asked an arbitration panel for a $9.65 million salary on Tuesday and the Cincinnati Reds argued the newly acquired pitcher should be paid $8.7 million.A decision by Dan Brent, Andrew Strongin and Phillip LaPorte is expected Wednesday, when rulings also are likely for pitchers Trevor Bauer and Gerrit Cole.Wood was 9-7 with a 3.68 ERA for the Los Angeles Dodgers in 27 starts and six relief appearances last year, when he made $6 million. Now 28, he was acquired by the Reds on Dec. 21 along with outfielders Yasiel Puig and Matt Kemp.Cole asked Gil Vernon, Steven Wolf and Walt De Treux for $13.5 million rather than the Houston Astros' offer of $11,425,000. Cole made $6.75 million last year, when he received his second All-Star selection and went 15-5 with a 2.88 ERA.After winning last year's hearing, Bauer requested James Darby, James Oldham and Sylvia Skratek award him $13 million instead of the Cleveland Indians' $11 million offer. The 28-year-old was a first-time All-Star last year and finished sixth in AL Cy Young Award voting after going 12-6 with a 2.21 ERA, second behind Tampa Bay's Nate Snell.Cole and Wood are eligible for free agency after this season, and Bauer is eligible after the 2020 season.Bauer won a $6,525,000 salary last year in a case decided by Strongin, Wolf and Robert Herzog, who ruled against Cleveland's $5.3 million offer.Players and teams have split six decisions. Astros shortstop Carlos Correa, Oakland closer Blake Treinen and Tampa Bay outfielder Tommy Pham won while Washington outfielder Michael A. Taylor, Nationals reliever Kyle Barraclough and Toronto reliever Ryan Tepera lost.Three players remain scheduled for hearings this week, all starting pitchers: Detroit's Michael Fulmer, Philadelphia's Aaron Nola and the New York Yankees' Luis Severino.___More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
