The Argentine star spent his entire 16-year NBA career with San Antonio, winning four championships while wearing No. 20."It was good to feel that vibe and that energy in the building for something that's bigger than our team," Spurs guard Patty Mills said. "That's what we are acknowledging tonight, someone who has sacrificed so much to this organization and has understood that the big picture is much bigger than himself."Bryn Forbes got the crowd going with a 3-pointer 13 seconds into the game, and the Spurs finished 14 for 33 from long range.

"We just came out with a more conscious effort of being aggressive. That's what we did and we can't wait to do that. We waited and made it tough on ourselves, but we pulled it through."Contributions from the bench helped the Spurs win as Ginobili and a host of former Spurs teammates like Duncan, Tony Parker, Bruce Bowen, David Robinson and others watched from the stands."You understand that you've got to play with passion and you've got to play with heart," Mills said. "You have to play with your heart on your sleeve and that's what Manu had done so well and what made him great."After Cleveland pulled to 111-110, Mills hit a 3-pointer off a drive and kick by DeRozan with 14 seconds remaining. Mills celebrated at midcourt and DeRozan ran behind him and embraced him as the Cavaliers called a timeout."Down the stretch when we needed to execute, we just didn't," Cleveland coach Larry Drew said.

"I'm absolutely serious."He's looked at everything and my guess is, if he stays in basketball, it will be more on management side. Management, scouting, putting the big pictures together. He doesn't want to sit in the film room and watch pick-and-roll all day. That's pretty boring."IF ONLYDeRozan's one regret about joining the Spurs this season is that he didn't get a chance to play with Ginobili before he retired."I wish I would have had a year to play with him, but to be able to witness this should be pretty cool," DeRozan said about the ceremony.DeRozan has now been a part of Miami Heat star Dwyane Wade's warm send-off by the Spurs last week and Ginobili's retirement ceremony."It's an honor, man," DeRozan said.
