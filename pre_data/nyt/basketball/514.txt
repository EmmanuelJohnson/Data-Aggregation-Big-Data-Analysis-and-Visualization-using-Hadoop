Khris Middleton scored 39 points as the Milwaukee Bucks moved closer to securing the top record in the Eastern Conference with a 128-118 victory Thursday over the visiting Los Angeles Clippers.The victory came with some concern, however, as Giannis Antetokounmpo left the game with 7:46 remaining and did not return after sustaining a right ankle injury when he stepped on the foot of the Clippers' Garrett Temple.Antetokounmpo's status moving forward was not immediately known, although he did remain on the bench for the remainder of the contest. Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer did not express significant concern after the game and said the team would wait to see how their star player feels on Friday.Antetokounmpo finished with 34 points as the Bucks remained four games ahead of the second-place Toronto Raptors.

He had nine of his points in the fourth quarter. Luka Doncic had 19 points, eight rebounds and seven assists for the Mavericks.Spurs 116, Cavaliers 110DeMar DeRozan scored 25 points, 21 of them in the second half, but his assist on a 3-pointer by Patty Mills with 14.5 seconds left proved to be the key play in San Antonio's win over visiting Cleveland.The Spurs shrugged off a ragged first half, moved to the lead in the third quarter and held off the Cavaliers in the fourth for the win, its 11th in its past 14 games.The victory allowed the Spurs, the eighth-place team in the Western Conference standings, to gain a half-game on seventh-place Oklahoma City.
