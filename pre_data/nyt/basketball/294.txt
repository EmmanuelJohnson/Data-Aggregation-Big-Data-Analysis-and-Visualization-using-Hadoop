Texas A&M Coach Gary Blair raved about Shambria Washington’s contributions in the days leading up to the team’s second-round N.C.A.A. tournament game, noting that it wasn’t easy for a guard to play in the shadow of the star Chennedy Carter.On Sunday her importance to the team was on full display when Washington hit the go-ahead 3-pointer late to send the Aggies to their second straight round of 16 with a 78-76 win over Marquette.Washington, who is in her first season at Texas A&M after beginning her career at a junior college, had 13 points and 6 assists to help the Aggies get past fifth-seeded Marquette.Carter scored 30 points to help No. 4 Texas A&M (26-7) advance to meet the winner of Monday night’s game between Michigan State and Notre Dame.“It doesn’t really bother me that I’m in the shadows,” Washington said. “I kind of like it.”But before she could finish her thought, Carter broke in to laud her teammate.“Sham is really the backbone of our team,” she said. “She’s the engine. She really gets us going.”A jump shot by Allazia Blockton tied it with a minute left, and Amani Wilborn made 1 of 2 free throws with 36 seconds remaining, but a lane violation by A&M gave her one more shot. She made it to put Marquette up by 76-74.Carter found Washington on A&M’s next possession, and she hit the 3-pointer to put the Aggies ahead, 77-76, with 23 seconds left.Carter stole an inbounds pass from Danielle King after a timeout with five seconds left, and she was fouled by King.The Golden Eagles had to foul two more times to get in the bonus, leaving just 0.9 of a second left when Carter made 1 of 2 free throws to secure the win.Natisha Hiedeman had 18 points to lead Marquette (27-8), which was in the tournament for the third straight season.Robbi Ryan’s free throws with five seconds left off a Miami turnover put Arizona State ahead to stay, and the fifth-seeded Sun Devils ousted the No. 4 Hurricanes, 57-55, in a second-round Portland Region game.Arizona State (22-10) was down by as many as 8 in the second half, and survived a game in which it shot 35 percent. Jamie Ruden came off the bench to score a team-best 10 for the Sun Devils.Laura Cornelius scored 15 for Miami (25-9), which was looking for its first round-of-16 berth since 1992. Mykea Gray added 13 for the Hurricanes, and Beatrice Mompremier grabbed 22 rebounds.With 42 seconds left and South Carolina leading by 1, Coach Dawn Staley decided to put the game in the hands of the junior point guard Tyasha Harris.Harris drove, kept the ball, and banked a one-handed layup off the glass and drew a foul. She completed the 3-point play, making it a two-possession game and helping fourth-seeded South Carolina hold on to beat No. 5 Florida State, 72-64, to advance to the round of 16 for the sixth straight season.In the past, Staley said, Harris might have deferred in those situations with better players around her. But not this time.“I was real thankful that she decided to shoot the ball, take it to the basket strong,” Staley said. “I was happy that she progressed in that moment to take that moment on.”Mikiah Herbert Harrigan scored 20 points, Alexis Jennings 16, Te’a Cooper 13 and Harris 11 for South Carolina (23-9).It’s the third time in the past five seasons the Gamecocks have eliminated the Seminoles from the N.C.A.A. tournament.

They quickly built a 19-4 lead that steadily increased.Akienreh Johnson had 12 points and Kayla Robbins 10 for Michigan (22-12).
