Caris LeVert will return to the Brooklyn Nets on Friday, giving the team a boost as it jockeys for playoff position.LeVert has been out since November with a dislocated foot. He had landed awkwardly on a block attempt in a game against the Minnesota Timberwolves and was carried from the court on a stretcher. Given the frightening nature of the injury, and the dark speculation at the time, Nets fans will be happy to see him returning comparatively quickly.LeVert, a wing, had been averaging 18.4 points a game for the team, second only to D’Angelo Russell’s 19.8. It had been a breakthrough year for him after seasons averaging 8 and 12 points a game. His return will come Friday in a home game against the Bulls.The Nets also recently welcomed back shooting guard Allen Crabbe. He played Wednesday night for the first time after a two-month absence with a knee injury. He had 5 points in 13 minutes in a home victory over the Nuggets.But it is not all good news for the Nets. Spencer Dinwiddie, the team’s point guard and third-leading scorer, has missed the last seven games with a thumb injury and could be out for a month or more.The Nets, widely expected to be among the N.B.A. doormats when the season started, are in the heat of the playoff race, currently occupying the sixth seed.“I can’t wait to be a part of that,” LeVert said Thursday. “I’m very excited.”
