I am confident that I am ready because of you," the letter reads, in part.Battle, who averaged 17.2 points per game this season, has been Syracuse's leading scorer the past two seasons.The Orange were eliminated by Baylor in the first round of the NCAA Tournament, with the junior guard scoring 16 points in the 78-69 loss.--Field Level Media
