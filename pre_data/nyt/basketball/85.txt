The former Auburn assistant basketball coach Chuck Person pleaded guilty on Tuesday to accepting nearly $100,000 to steer his players toward agents and advisers who had bribed him.Person was fired after the initial revelation of the charges in September 2017. He became the fourth assistant coach to plead guilty to charges that stemmed from cases alleging widespread corruption in college basketball recruiting. His bribery trial had been set to begin later this year.“As he has now admitted, Chuck Person abused his position as a coach and mentor to student-athletes in exchange for personal gain,” Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a statement. “In taking tens of thousands of dollars in cash bribes, Person not only placed personal financial gain above his obligations to his employer and the student-athletes he coached, but he broke the law.”Person’s lawyer declined to comment.Person starred at Auburn before a successful N.B.A. career in the 1980s and 1990s.In a separate but related case, a jury in October convicted a former Adidas executive, a former Adidas consultant and an aspiring agent of fraud for attempting to funnel money from the apparel giant to the families of high school prospects in exchange for their commitment to colleges Adidas sponsored. Earlier this month, those men were given commensurately lenient sentences that nonetheless included prison.Two of those men are set to be tried in another case next month. Their lawyers have disputed basic facts alleged by prosecutors — to an extent they did not in the first case, which rested more on a debate over whether their conduct constituted not only illicit behavior but federal crimes. The case may include testimony from some of the best-known coaches in college basketball.
