ALBANY, N.Y. â€” Louisville coach Jeff Walz breathed a big sigh of relief. His top-seeded Cardinals clamped down on defense again and now they're headed to the Elite Eight."We knew coming into this it was going to be hard-fought game," Walz said after his Cardinals defeated No. 4 seed Oregon State 61-44 in the Albany Regional semifinals on Friday night. "We did a really, really good job of preparation and our players were confident in what we had gone over. That's half the battle. It gives you a good sense of calm."Sam Fuehring and Asia Durr each had 17 points for the Cardinals, who held the Beavers to 2-of-22 shooting from beyond the arc, 0 for 5 in the decisive third quarter. They shot 38 percent from 3 during the season but had struggled in the tournament, shooting just 30 percent in the first two games."I loved our effort tonight," Oregon State coach Scott Rueck said. "I thought we played an excellent game, with the exception of shooting the ball. The ball just didn't fall and that's basketball."They did a nice job taking the rim away, forced us into perimeter shots. That's something that we're very comfortable with. For whatever reason they just didn't go."Louisville (32-3) will meet UConn (34-2) on Sunday for a berth in the Final Four. The Huskies defeated UCLA 69-61 in the first game.
