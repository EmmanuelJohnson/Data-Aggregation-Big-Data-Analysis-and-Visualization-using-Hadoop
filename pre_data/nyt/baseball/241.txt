At a time when the despoliation of our planet is very much on people’s minds, the wildcatters of “The Iron Orchard” hardly feel like heroes. Seemingly nostalgic for a period when West Texas roughnecks settled scores with baseball bats and laid pipe with pickaxes, this lovingly made homage to avarice feels strangely limp. Instead of gushing, it trickles.Spanning the late 1930s to late 1950s, the story follows Jim McNeely (a flavorless Lane Garrison), from penniless store clerk to amoral oil tycoon. Toughened up by caricature bullies at his first oil-company job, he saves his salary, steals a co-worker’s wife (Ali Cobrin) and heads west to seek his fortune. As his hats and wallet swell, so does his gut, and flashbacks to his hometown honey in Fort Worth (Hassie Harrison) prepare us for romantic strife to come. Were he not such an arrogant jerk, we might even care when, en route to an ending much kinder than he deserves, challenges like swamp gas and a friend’s suicide temporarily slow his roll.In this adaptation of Edmund Pendleton Van Zandt, Jr.’s 1966 novel of the same name, the director, Ty Roberts, slaves over the visuals to the clear detriment of everything else. The dialogue (by Roberts and Gerry De Leon) is dire, the drama negligible and McNeely has more chemistry with his rigs and immaculate vintage cars than with either of his women. That leaves us with Mathieu Plainfossé’s rich cinematography, and sometimes it’s enough: His windblown plains and steely skies, throbbing sunsets and soaring derricks have a resonance and nobility that McNeely’s sorry struggles will never possess.
