The Mets have sat out the protracted, high-profile negotiations for Bryce Harper and Manny Machado, the 26-year-old superstars whose free agency has dominated baseball’s winter headlines. But they have stayed busy adding depth to their roster in the last few days, and they formalized a role for their former captain on Monday.David Wright, 36, is younger than the Mets’ new second baseman, Robinson Cano, but was forced to retire in September because of chronic injuries. He was formally released from the roster on Monday and officially joined the front office as a special adviser to Chief Operating Officer Jeff Wilpon and General Manager Brodie Van Wagenen.Wright assisted the Mets’ contingent at the winter meetings in Las Vegas last month, meeting with free agents and impressing Van Wagenen with his perspective. Wright, who found behind-the-scenes work to be more appealing than coaching or broadcasting, thanked the Mets’ ownership and their fans in a statement on Monday.“Playing in this city and for this team was a dream come true,” the statement said. “I look forward to contributing and taking on the challenges of this new role.”Before their announcement on Wright, the Mets made three minor trades to fortify their roster, acquiring center fielder Keon Broxton from the Milwaukee Brewers, infielder/outfielder J.D. Davis from the Houston Astros and starter Walker Lockett from the Cleveland Indians.Kevin Plawecki, a backup catcher since 2015, went to the Indians in the deal for Lockett, 24, who made four appearances (three starts) for San Diego last season, going 0-3 with a 9.60 E.R.A.Broxton, 28, was a regular for the Brewers in 2017, appearing in 143 games with 20 homers and 21 stolen bases. He is a .221 career hitter but gives the Mets another excellent defensive center fielder to go with Juan Lagares.Davis, 25, has hit .194 in 66 games with the Astros over the last two seasons. But he led the Pacific Coast League in hitting last season, at .342, and started at third base, first base and left field for the Astros.The Mets traded three prospects each in the Broxton and Davis deals. None ranked among the team’s top prospects and only one — reliever Bobby Wahl, who came over from Oakland for Jeurys Familia last summer and was traded to the Brewers — appeared in the majors last season.
