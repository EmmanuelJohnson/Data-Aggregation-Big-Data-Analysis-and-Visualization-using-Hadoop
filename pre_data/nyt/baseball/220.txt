CLEVELAND â€” Opponents of the Cleveland Indians' Chief Wahoo logo are planning to demonstrate before the club's home opener even though team has dropped the mascot from their caps and jerseys.Organizers of the protest say they still want the team to change its name.That's why they'll be outside Progressive Field again when Cleveland opens its home season against the Chicago White Sox on April 1.The cartoonish, red faced logo has been part of the team's history for more than 60 years.The team decided in early 2018 to bench the polarizing Chief Wahoo this season after lengthy talks with the leaders of Major League Baseball.But one of the protest organizers tells cleveland.com that fans won't stop dressing up like Native Americans until the name is changed.___Information from: cleveland.com, http://www.cleveland.com
