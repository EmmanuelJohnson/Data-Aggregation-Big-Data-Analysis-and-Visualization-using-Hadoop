Greg Schiano, hired last month as the New England Patriots defensive coordinator, stepped down Thursday, the team announced."This is not the result of any one event, but rather a realization that I need to spend more time on my faith and family," Schiano said in a statement. "I don't want to look back years from now and wish I had done things differently. Therefore, I am taking time away from the game to recalibrate my priorities."Schiano was hired Feb. 6 to replace Brian Flores, the Patriots' defensive play-caller who left to become the head coach of the Miami Dolphins."I respect Coach Schiano greatly and appreciate his contributions to our staff and team," coach Bill Belichick said in a statement. "He is a friend who we support completely."Schiano, 52, was most recently the defensive coordinator at Ohio State. He was 11-21 in two seasons as the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' head coach in 2012 and 2013 before being fired.Schiano was 68-67 in 11 seasons as the head coach at Rutgers (2001-2011). He is a longtime ally of Belichick, whose son, Steve Belichick, was a long snapper at Rutgers.--Field Level Media
