NEW DELHI â€” Julian Suri scored a second consecutive round of 67 and took a two-shot lead at the Indian Open on Friday.Last year here, Suri went home after carding 76-82. This is only the American's second event of the season after undergoing surgery on an abdominal hernia.He went out in 30 after five birdies, an eagle, and a bogey. He came in much quieter, with a lone bogey, to be at 10 under overall."I put the foot down but I had the same mindset I had on the first nine," Suri said. "I hit it really well the whole day and I just tried to free it up a little bit on the second nine with my putting."He's won once before on the European Tour, at the Denmark Open in 2017.Two shots behind him were South Africa's George Coetzee (66) and Sweden's Robert Karlsson (68). Coetzee birdied his last three holes, and Karlsson his last two.Another shot further back at 7 under were Callum Shinkwin of England (65) and Scott Hend of Australia (68), who both enjoyed bogey-free rounds.___
