NEW DELHI â€” Julian Suri and Callum Shinkwin share a two-shot lead at the Indian Open after a dramatic finish to the third round on Saturday.Shinkwin shot a 4-under 68 before Suri (71) sent a terrible tee shot into a hazard on the par-5 18th, leading to a double bogey for the American. That left both players with an overall 11-under-par 205."I think a couple of the mistakes I made today were after long waits on the tee box and that was quite a long wait on 18," Suri said. "No excuses, totally my fault, and I need to compose myself better and I think that is a bit of a learning curve for me after being out of tournament golf for a while now."This is only Suri's second event of the season after undergoing surgery on an abdominal hernia but he has played well with rounds of 67 on the first two days.Overnight leader Suri has won once before on the European Tour, at the Denmark Open in 2017.England's Shinkwin shot a 7-under 65 on Friday.Japan's Masahiro Kawamura (68) made a good recovery from a triple bogey on the par-5 eighth and sits at 9 under, a shot ahead of Scotland's Stephen Gallacher (67) in fourth.___
