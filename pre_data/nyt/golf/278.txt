Destinations stepping up efforts to promote themselves.On a brisk winter morning, a young Chinese couple stroll through Edinburgh Castle, taking in the history of this iconic attraction in the Scottish capital.Xie Zhuoqun and Meng Hongfei are two of a growing number of Chinese to visit the popular landmark.Xie, 32, from Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, said her attention was drawn to Edinburgh when she came across a random Sina Weibo social media post about Hogmanay － the Scottish celebration marking the Western New Year.“I was mesmerized by the city’s atmosphere, the fireworks over the castle, the torch processions on the Royal Mile and the ubiquitous street parties. From that point onward, I knew I wanted to see Edinburgh in person, and here we are,” she said.Revenue from Chinese visitors to the city has risen by almost 350 percent over the past decade, according to Scotland’s tourism authority VisitScotland.To help reap the benefits from the rising ranks of Chinese tourists, destinations across Scotland are stepping up efforts to welcome these visitors from afar.Chinese-language signs and posters are dotted around popular tourist spots in Edinburgh, where busloads of visitors explore and enjoy the sights.Scottish businesses, such as the jewelry brand Hamilton & Inches, and luxury fashion accessories label Strathberry, have hired Mandarin-speaking personnel and social media professionals to cater to the growing number of Chinese visitors.Daniel Turner, senior lecturer in marketing, events and tourism at the University of West Scotland, said there is a natural synergy between traditional Scottish tourism offerings and the Chinese market.Turner attributes the rise in visitors from China to Scotland’s rich tourism resources that look to accommodate the mounting number of middle-class Chinese arrivals.“Scotland, I believe, identified the emergence of a Chinese market very early and realized that our natural, indigenous tourism resources － whisky, golf, our cultural heritage － would be very attractive to the emerging middle class and ‘lifestyle’ tourist market from China as it grew in wealth and size,” he said.Turner said that beyond this there is a strong relationship between the two countries, evidenced by China loaning two pandas to Edinburgh Zoo, which created a cultural link between the nations that helped to promote Scotland as a destination.Malcom Roughead, chief executive of VisitScotland, said the country has been “on the radar” for Chinese visitors for a long time. He added that the growth in new air links － including a direct route between Beijing and Edinburgh launched in June － has helped boost the market, making it easier for Chinese visitors to travel to Scotland.“We have recognized for some time the potential of China as a market for Scotland, and it is now considered a priority one for VisitScotland,” he said. “Scotland accounts for almost one-fifth of Chinese visitors to the U.K., and with enhanced connectivity there is a real opportunity to grow that market.”Travel agencies in Scotland said the number of Chinese visitors has doubled in recent years.Li Wei, founder of Go2Scotland, said that each year he handles about 100 groups of independent Chinese travelers, compared with almost none two years ago.“This is mainly because a great number of Chinese had visited the U.K. more than two or three times and wanted to explore new areas. Hence, Scotland became an interest,” Li said.The 2014 Scottish Independence Referendum, when 55 percent voted “no”, raised Scotland’s profile worldwide, including in China. “Chinese became curious about the place and wanted to visit,” he added.A digital campaign aimed at luring more Chinese tourists to Scotland has also helped boost tourist numbers.The Edinburgh Chinese Social Media Campaign, launched in 2016 by the Edinburgh Tourism Action Group, also known as ETAG, was initially created to promote the city. It was later extended to the whole of Scotland, and advertises it as a must-visit destination through online campaigns and by posting strategic destination content.The campaign uses the Chinese social media platforms Sina Weibo and WeChat to deliver tips, itineraries and promotions in Mandarin from the city’s most popular tourism businesses. It recommends key points of interest for Chinese travelers, such as history, architecture, film locations and shopping.While Scotland is promoting itself as an attractive destination for Chinese visitors, it is also making increasing efforts to ensure tourism businesses understand these visitors’ requirements.The China Ready Initiative, launched by ETAG in 2015, has seen more than 300 businesses, including key attractions, hotels, festivals and retailers around Edinburgh and across Scotland, engage with cultural awareness workshops, guides and meetings aimed at increasing Chinese visitor numbers and developing the country’s position as a China-friendly destination.Rob Lang, who chairs the initiative, said it has helped put local businesses in a much stronger position to understand and benefit from the growing inbound Chinese market, and as a result, an increasing number of Scottish businesses are willing to tap this trade.The Balmoral Hotel in Edinburgh is one of the businesses that have benefited from the initiative.Melissa Raffaelli, the hotel’s director of sales, visited China for the first time in March, realizing the importance of first-hand experience in familiarizing herself with Chinese tourists’ requirements.“From being out in China myself and asking people what is important to the customer ... what is a minimum requirement, one of the key things people kept saying is you need staff,” Raffaelli said. She also noted a real thirst for knowledge and history from Chinese who visit Scotland.Raffaelli has visited China three times since March, which led to the hotel introducing initiatives aimed at welcoming Chinese guests. These included offering toothbrushes and toothpaste in the rooms, as well as congee and fried noodles on the menu. There is also the Balmoral’s Afternoon Tea Masterclass, with a translator explaining in Mandarin the finer points of this British tradition.“Our business from China, from May to September, increased by 17 percent compared with the same time in 2017,” said Raffaelli, who is confident that revenue will continue to rise.One Scottish institution well on the way to reaping the rewards of courting China is The Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo, an annual event staged at Edinburgh Castle.Brigadier David Allfrey, its chief executive and producer, said, “In 2016, ticket sales to Chinese visitors for the Tattoo increased by more than 600 percent, so we know there is a real appetite for our event among the Chinese public.”To meet this growing demand, the Tattoo in 2017 launched WeChat Pay facilities, the first Scottish tourism business to roll out such a system, which allows easier ticket purchases from the Chinese market, and which is increasing its presence on WeChat and Sina Weibo.With the increase in Chinese visiting the Tattoo each year, Allfrey said there are plans to take the event to China in 2020.Wang Mingjie
