He ended the round with six consecutive pars.Kuchar will aim for his second championship in about two months after winning the Mayakoba Golf Classic in November in Mexico.Kuchar opened with consecutive rounds of 63 this week.

He opened the round with birdies on each of the first three holes.He’s among a cluster of golfers at 11-under.Corey Conners, Davis Love III, Charles Howell III, Dominic Bozzelli and Brian Stuard will all begin the final round tied at 11-under.
