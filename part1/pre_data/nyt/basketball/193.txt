Nebraska hired former Chicago Bulls and Iowa State head coach Fred Hoiberg as its basketball coach on Saturday, giving him a seven-year deal worth $25 million, the school announced.Hoiberg, who was born in Lincoln, Neb., reportedly first was approached about the position in February, when Tim Miles was still coaching the team. The two sides had talks about the position throughout the week."I can't express how excited I am to be back on the sidelines and to be coaching at a university that means a lot to my family and me," Hoiberg said in a statement."Lincoln is a special place for our family. I was born in Lincoln, my grandfather Jerry Bush was the head coach at Nebraska, my other grandfather was a long-time professor there, and my parents are proud graduates of the University of Nebraska. Nebraska has always felt like a second home."Bush was Nebraska's head coach from 1954-63.Miles, 52, was fired Tuesday, two days after the Cornhuskers (19-17) ended their season with an 88-72 loss at TCU in the second round of the NIT. In seven seasons at the Lincoln school, Miles compiled a 116-114 record, and his Huskers only reached the NCAA Tournament in 2013-14.During his coaching stint at Iowa State from 2010-15, Hoiberg's teams made four NCAA Tournament appearances, including a trip to the Sweet 16 in 2014, and posted an overall 115-56 record.He became the head coach of the Bulls on June 2, 2015, and was fired on Dec. 3, 2018. His overall record with the Bulls was 115-155 (.426), including a 5-19 (.208) start this season.Hoiberg, 46, guided the Bulls to one postseason appearance, losing to the Boston Celtics in the first round of the 2017 Eastern Conference playoffs.--Field Level Media
