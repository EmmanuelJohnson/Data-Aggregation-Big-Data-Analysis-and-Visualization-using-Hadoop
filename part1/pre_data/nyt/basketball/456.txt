LOS ANGELES â€” Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James will sit out the remaining six games of the NBA season to nurse a lingering groin injury, the team said on Saturday."After consulting with our team doctors and medical staff, we have decided to hold LeBron out of games for the remainder of the season," the team said in a statement."This decision will allow his groin to fully heal, and is best for the future success of both LeBron and the Lakers."LeBron's first season with the Lakers was largely a disappointment.The team was eliminated from playoff contention last week and the 34-year-old James missed 17 games during the season with the injured groin.The Lakers will turn their attention this offseason to finding another player to complement James, with many expecting Lakers president Magic Johnson to target New Orleans Pelicans power forward Anthony Davis.LeBron joined in Lakers in July when he signed a four-year, $153 million deal as part of an effort to restore the storied franchise to relevance.(Reporting by Rory Carroll, editing by Pritha Sarkar)
