Duke was given the No. 1 overall seed in the N.C.A.A. Division I men’s basketball tournament Sunday night, starting Coach Mike Krzyzewski and his star freshman Zion Williamson on a path to what they hope will be the Blue Devils’ sixth national title.Duke (29-5) was one of three Atlantic Coast Conference teams to receive top seeds, joining Virginia (29-3) and North Carolina (27-6). It was the second time members of the same conference were named three of the four No. 1s; the Big East did so in 2009.The fourth No. 1 seed was Gonzaga (30-3), the small stalwart from Spokane, Wash. While the Bulldogs lost the West Coast Conference title game to St. Mary’s last week, they already have a win over Duke on their résumé from a tournament in late November in Hawaii.[Region previews: East | West | South | Midwest]Of course, a top seed is no ticket to the Final Four in Minneapolis. Or even to the second round. Last year, for the first time in 136 such games, a No. 16 seed defeated a No. 1 when the University of Maryland-Baltimore County stunned Virginia.The No. 2 seeds are Michigan State (28-6), Tennessee (29-5), Kentucky (27-6) and Michigan (28-6). The first of these edged the last of these in the Big Ten conference final minutes before the bracket was released. Yet it was the defeated Wolverines who received the privilege of placement in the West alongside Gonzaga, while the Spartans — who won all three games against their in-state rival this season — landed in Duke’s dreaded quadrant.The Blue Devils finished the regular season on a 3-3 skid without Williamson, who sprained his knee when his shoe ripped open during a game on Feb. 20. But Williamson, the prospective No. 1 overall pick in the N.B.A. draft, returned last week, and Duke proceeded to stomp through the A.C.C. tournament. Williamson set the Duke scoring record for that event, with 81 points.The selection committee effectively ignored the non-Williamson .500 squad and instead considered the team that has won every game except for a 2-point loss to Gonzaga and an overtime loss to Syracuse (20-13). It is Duke’s first No. 1 seed since 2015, which is also the last year it won the tournament.“They earned their right to be there,” said the selection committee chairman, Bernard Muir, who is Stanford’s athletic director, when he appeared on CBS’s selection show to discuss the bracket.The most challenging of the four regions appeared to be the South, topped by Virginia. If the Cavaliers get past 16-seeded Gardner-Webb (23-11) on Friday — a game they surely will not take for granted after last year — they could face a No. 8-seeded Mississippi (20-12) that has four wins over tournament teams. Then potential round of 16 opponents include Wisconsin (23-10), underseeded at No. 5, or fourth-seeded Kansas State (25-8), which came close to the Final Four last year.The South final could well feature No. 2-seeded Tennessee (29-5) or No. 3-seeded Purdue (23-9). Both teams are ranked in the top 10 of KenPom.com’s efficiency ratings, a list Virginia sits atop. And either might have home-court advantage at Louisville’s KFC Yum Center.EASTSOUTHPrintable VersionDuke 851Virginia 711Duke 77Virginia 63COLUMBIA, S.C.COLUMBIA, S.C.North Dakota State 6216Duke 75Virginia 53Gardner-Webb 5616Virginia Commonwealth 588Mississsippi 728Oklahoma 51CentralFlorida 76Virginia (32-3)Duke (32-5)Oklahoma 959Central Florida 739Mississippi State 765Wisconsin 545Oregon 73Liberty 58SAN JOSE, CALIF.SAN JOSE, CALIF.Oregon 7212Liberty 8012Virginia Tech 73Oregon 49Virginia Tech 664Kansas State 644U.C.

He was suspended after a report emerged that he had discussed making an offer to a recruit on a phone call with an aspiring agent convicted of fraud in college recruiting.The East has other ties to scandal. Seventh-seeded Louisville (20-13) faces 10th-seeded Minnesota (21-13) in the first round, a game that might have been a father-son matchup between Rick and Richard Pitino had the former not been let go as Louisville’s coach in 2017 shortly after corruption allegations became public. And L.S.U.’s first game is against No. 14 Yale (21-7), the Ivy League co-champion, whose women’s soccer program was caught up in the admissions scandal that federal prosecutors revealed last week.In the national semifinals, the East winner, which will be determined in Washington, will face the West winner. In addition to Gonzaga and Michigan, contenders in that region include third-seeded Texas Tech (26-6), which was considered the best team in the strong Big 12 but was upset in the conference tournament by West Virginia (14-20); and fourth-seeded Florida State (27-7), which looked every bit Duke’s equal in the first half of the A.C.C. title game on Saturday. The West also features two mid-major darlings: No. 6 Buffalo (31-3) and No. 7 Nevada (29-4). The West Regional is in Anaheim, Calif.North Carolina and Kentucky are fish out of water in the Midwest region, particularly given its setting. In the region semifinals, the Tar Heels could meet fourth-seeded Kansas (25-9), making its record-setting 30th straight N.C.A.A. tournament appearance, while the Wildcats might face sixth-seeded Iowa State (23-11). Those games will take place at Sprint Center in Kansas City, Mo. — a second home for the Jayhawks and Iowa State, who have combined to win the last seven Big 12 tournaments there.The Midwest also features fifth-seeded Auburn (25-9), the surprise Southeastern Conference winner Sunday. Tigers Coach Bruce Pearl, hired in 2014, was effectively barred from N.C.A.A. coaching for three years for recruiting violations at Tennessee. Chuck Person, a former Auburn assistant, was charged with bribery and fraud in the recruiting cases, and last Friday, prosecutors said in a court filing that Person was expected to plead guilty on Tuesday.The Big Ten led all conferences with eight teams in the tournament, while the Pacific-12 had only three. That number was actually larger than expected a week ago: Arizona State was given one of the last four at-large bids, and Oregon (23-13) surprised Washington (26-8) in the tournament final Saturday night to elbow its way into the field.The Ducks were one of several unlikely receivers of automatic spots who effectively constricted the pool of 36 at-large bids. In another example, St. Louis (23-12) won the Atlantic 10 tournament Sunday, granting the Billikens a slot alongside Virginia Commonwealth (25-7), which effectively took an at-large bid away from a bubble team by failing to win its conference tournament.This was the first year in decades that the N.C.A.A. did not use the much-maligned Rating Percentage Index, instead favoring the new N.C.A.A. Evaluation Tool. But the tournament field included 11th-seeded Arizona State (22-10) in its “last four in” despite the Sun Devils’ poor NET, while North Carolina State (22-11), a good-NET, bad-R.P.I. squad, was not even among the “first four out.”But aficionados will be pleased that Belmont (26-5) of the Ohio Valley earned an at-large bid; the Bruins will play Temple in the play-in game on Tuesday.“They made the most of the opportunities they had,” Muir said. “We just thought they were a phenomenal basketball team, very high on the offensive front — great offensive efficiency.”St. John’s (21-12) was the last team in; the Red Storm will face Arizona State in an opening game on Wednesday.
