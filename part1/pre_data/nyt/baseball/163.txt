The agreement comes just three days after the ace right-hander told reporters that he wasn't confident of a deal being struck before he takes the mound on Opening Day against the Washington Nationals on Thursday.Boston Red Sox pitcher Chris Sale agreed to a five-year, $145 million extension last Friday, and the Houston Astros reached a two-year, $66 million deal with former Cy Young winner Justin Verlander."Honestly, I really have been trying not to think about it," deGrom told reporters after his final spring training start. "Yeah, I said I wanted to get something done, but it's getting close to opening day and I think my focus is on that right now."The Mets and deGrom agreed to a one-year, $17 million contract rather than go to arbitration in January. He will now earn $7 million in 2019 to go with a $10 million signing bonus, $23 million in 2020, $33.5 million in 2021-22 and $30.5 million in 2023 with a club option in 2024, according to reports.DeGrom is coming off a 2018 season in which he posted a 1.70 ERA with 269 strikeouts in 32 starts and won the Cy Young despite going just 10-9 for a Mets team that finished 77-85. It was the lowest win total ever for a Cy Young winner, breaking the previous record of 13 set by the Seattle Mariners' Felix Hernandez in 2010.DeGrom won the National League Rookie of the Year award in 2014. Through five major league seasons, he is 55-41 with a 2.67 ERA and a 27.0 WAR to go with 1,000 strikeouts against 222 walks."Jake's the best pitcher in baseball right now," teammate Noah Syndergaard said Sunday. "I think he deserves whatever amount he's worth. I want to keep him happy, so when it does come time for him to reach free agency, he stays on our side pitching for the Mets. I just think they should quit all this fuss and pay the man already."--Field Level Media
