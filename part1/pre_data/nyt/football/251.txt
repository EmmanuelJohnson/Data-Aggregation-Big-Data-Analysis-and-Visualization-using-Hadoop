Two-time Pro Bowl offensive lineman T.J. Lang announced his retirement on Friday in a social media post.The 31-year-old Lang was released by the Detroit Lions earlier this month."For the past 3,624 days I have woken up with one goal in mind-How can I be a better pro football player than I was yesterday?" Lang wrote in a note attached to his Twitter account. "Well, those days are over now. ... I will forever cherish the great times that I had playing this game."Lang played 10 NFL seasons -- eight with the Green Bay Packers (2009-16) and the last two with the Lions. He was a Pro Bowl selection in 2016 for Green Bay and again the following season for the Lions.He was limited to just six games in 2018 due to a concussion and a neck injury.Overall, he played in 138 regular-season games, starting 113.Former Packers teammate Bryan Bulaga was among the players who congratulated Lang, who lined up at guard next to Bulaga during his Green Bay stint."Congrats on an amazing career @TJLang70!! It was an honor to share the field with you on Sundays and be the RT that played next to you. You were the epitome of a warrior on the field and even a better friend off of it! Hope you, Laura and the kids enjoy retirement."Lang thanked both the Packers and Lions in his retirement note."Whatever the next chapter holds, I hope to stay around the game in some capacity," Lang said in his note. "It's been an amazing ride. Thank you all for being a part of it."--Field Level Media
