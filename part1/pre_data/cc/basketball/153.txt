With the NBA rumor mill going full-speed ahead of Thursday's trade deadline, one of the league's biggest stars has had enough. Speaking publicly for the first time in several days, Golden State Warriors forward Kevin Durant blasted the media, questioning the assembled members' motives and why he even had to talk to them. The source of Durant's frustration appeared to be the rumors that he is heading to the New York Knicks this summer as a free agent. "I got nothing to do with the Knicks. I don't know who traded (Kristaps) Porzingis. It's got nothing to do with me, I'm trying to play basketball," Durant said. "Ya'll come in here every day, ask me about free agency — ask my teammates, my coaches, you rile up the fans about it. Let us play basketball, that's all I'm saying. "And now that I don't want to talk to ya'll it's a problem with me. Come on man, grow up. Grow up. "I come here and go to work every day, I don't cause no problems. I play the right way, or I try to play the right way, I try to be the best player I can be every possession. What's the problem, what am I doing to ya'll?NBA trade deadline tracker: All the movesRoundtable: Four pressing trade deadline questions addressed"You weren't talking to the media," a reporter interjected. "So, who are you? Why do I gotta talk to you? Tell me?" Durant responded. "Is that going to help me do my job better? I didn't feel like talking." Durant abruptly ended his press conference shortly thereafter. While the frustration on the two-time Finals MVP was palpable, the rumors seem to be having almost no impact on him or the Warriors on the court. Before Durant's tirade, the Warriors ran the San Antonio Spurs out of Oracle Arena, 141-102, on Wednesday night. Durant had 23 points, eight rebounds and nine assists in the blowout win. Golden State has lost just twice so far in 2019 while putting up 13 wins. Follow USA TODAY Sports' Jace Evans on Twitter @JaceTEvans.
