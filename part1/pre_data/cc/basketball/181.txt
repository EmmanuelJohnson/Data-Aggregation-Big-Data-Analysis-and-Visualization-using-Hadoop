Six championships by all means."Jordan praised both players for what they're doing, noting that both streaks are hard to accomplish.Jordan said the milestones show "the talent that we have within the league.""It shows progression in the league," Jordan said during an interview at his Hornets facility while discussing the upcoming All-Star weekend."I am very proud of how both guys have done because they are making a mark for the league and I think it really helps grow the league."Harden needed a late scoring spree on Monday night to extend his streak to 30 games, scoring 11 points in the final 100 seconds as the Rockets defeated the Dallas Mavericks 120-104.
