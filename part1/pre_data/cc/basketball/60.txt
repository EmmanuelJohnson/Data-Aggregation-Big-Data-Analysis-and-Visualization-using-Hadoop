PHOENIX (AP) â€” The Denver Nuggets have the best record in the Western Conference; the Phoenix Suns have the worst.On top of that, the Suns were without scoring leader Devin Booker.But the mismatch that was supposed to happen Saturday night never did. Quite the opposite, as the Suns took the lead in the first quarter and never faltered in a 102-93 victory."That team outplayed us tonight," Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. "They played harder than us tonight, and it was apparent throughout the game."Kelly Oubre Jr. matched his career high with 26 points and tied his career best with 11 rebounds for Phoenix. Deandre Ayton added 23 points and 13 rebounds for the Suns, who have won two of three with Booker sidelined with back spasms."We were the aggressors today," Ayton said. "That's the main part of it."Nikola Jokic had 21 points and 10 rebounds for the Nuggets. Malik Beasley scored 20 points."I think we just thought it was going to be easy," Jokic said. "...I think we played their record, not their personnel. Those guys are playing hard right now."Denver fell to just a half-game ahead of Golden State for best record in the West.It might have been Phoenix's best defensive effort of the season."What impressed me the most is just how long we did it," the Suns' Josh Jackson said. "We did it for literally the whole game. Like, I can't remember one point in time when I looked up and I felt like we were playing bad defense."Coach Igor Kokoskov said it's one thing to have a good game plan, and another to execute it."From the game plan, to the film, to the court, there's a long, long way," he said. "Players play the game and win a game, so that's what it is. We showed up and played well."The Suns took the lead for good late in the first quarter and were up by as many as 16 in the second and 18 in the third.
