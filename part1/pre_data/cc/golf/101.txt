Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher Archie Bradley is back in possession of his prized golf clubs.The reliever posted a photo of himself with two thumbs up next to his PXG standbag featuring his name and his team's logo.Bradley says he got them back on Sunday, four days after his bag disappeared after the Waste Management Phoenix Open pro-am.Bradley had finished fourth in the pro-am, while being caddied by his dad, who sported a matching beard and a similarly vibrant Hawaiian shirt. He discovered the clubs' disappearance later and took to social media to help find them.In his red-alert message, he says he "can't comment much due to investigation."But he thanked everyone who helped with getting the clubs returned.A tweet on Saturday from the Scottsdale Police Department no doubt helped. It showed a photo and description of the suspect.WANT MORE? Get the latest golf news and analysis at GolfweekPHOENIX OPEN: Rickie Fowler blows five-shot lead, recovers to winBradley's group had beaten out Patrick Peterson of the Arizona Cardinals and Olympic swimming legend Michael Phelps, among other stars, during the pro-am.He also beat his own manager, Torey Lovullo, who spoke highly of Bradley while meeting with the media that morning.And if that weren't enough, Bradley even got to hold the Phoenix Open gopher. The Waste Management Green Gopher patrols the lake near the 17th and 18th holes in his boat at TPC Scottsdale.Diamondbacks pitchers and catchers report Feb. 13, so Bradley will have some time still to play more golf before switching back to baseball for the season.Last July, Bradley was reunited with his dog Crash, who ran away, after he turned to social media for help. So you might say that the Diamondbacks reliever is 2-for-2 on off-field saves.
