Phil Mickelson was on fire Thursday in his 2019 PGA Tour debut. In the first round of the Desert Classic, Mickelson was on 59-watch until the final two holes.

His previous rounds of 60 both came at the Waste Management Phoenix Open at TPC Scottsdale, in 2013 and 2005 on a par-71. He went on to win both of those tournaments. With several players still on the course, Mickelson finished the day with a three-shot lead over Adam Long.Mickelson's previous lowest score in his first round of the year also came at the Desert Classic. He won the tournament in 2002 after starting with a 64.Lefty began his round with back-to-back birdies on the opening two holes. He went on to card a 6-under 30 on the front nine, adding two more birdies and an eagle on the par-5, 527-yard sixth hole. DESERT SUN: Phil proves he's still capable of bringing the thrillJUSTIN ROSE: No. 1 player brings new goals to Desert ClassicTIGER WOODS: 43 reasons why he will win another major titleMickelson stayed hot on the back, birdieing four of the first five holes.
