BOCA RATON, Fla. (AP) â€” Bernhard Langer eagled the par-5 18th for a 4-under 68 and a one-stroke lead Saturday in the PGA Tour Champions' Oasis Championship.Langer rebounded from a bogey on the par-4 17th with the eagle to reach 12-under 132 at The Old Course at Broken Sound."It was sweet after making bogey on 17 from the middle of the fairway," Langer said. "After making my first bogey of the week there, it was nice to finish with three perfect shots."The 61-year-old German star won the 2010 event and finished second last year, two strokes behind Mark Calcavecchia. Langer lives 10 minutes from the course."I know the golf course, know how to play it," Langer said. "It's a shot-maker's course. You've got to drive the ball well and hit greens and hopefully roll a few in. There's no excuse if I mess up because I know how to play every hole. But the wind makes it very tough, always does, and the wind was up today and it's probably going to be blowing even more tomorrow."Marco Dawson was second after a 67, and David Toms (67) and Brandt Jobe (65) were two strokes back at 10 under in the first full-field event of the season. First-round leader Jesper Parnevik followed his opening 63 with a 72 to drop into a tie for fifth at 9 under with Bob Estes (68), Tom Byrum (69) and Woody Austin (70).Fred Couples was 8 under after a 69.Retief Goosen was tied for 18th at 6 under after his second 69 in his senior debut.Gary Nicklaus, also making his first tour start, followed an opening 67 with a 77 to fall into a tie for 49th at even par. The 50-year-old son of Jack Nicklaus is playing on a sponsor exemption.
