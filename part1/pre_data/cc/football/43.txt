And then there were eight.The NFL's divisional playoff weekend approaches with a scrumptious quartet of games on the menu. With the exception of Eagles-Saints — New Orleans is the most heavily favored team this weekend — our panel of USA TODAY Sports' NFL experts was highly divided regarding the outcomes of the playoffs' second round.It's especially noteworthy that half our crew foresees the sixth-seeded Colts upsetting the top-seeded Chiefs and extending Kansas City's postseason losing streak at Arrowhead Stadium to seven. Half are also predicting the Chargers to knock off the Patriots even though New England hasn't failed to reach the AFC Championship Game since 2010.Finally, a shoutout to our rookie prognosticator Jori Epstein, who went a staff-best 3-1 straight up and against the spread on wild-card weekend — while serving up a cold dish of comeuppance to one of her smart aleck colleagues who'd hoped she would face-plant out of the chute. (Touché, Epstein ... you hooked 'em.)
