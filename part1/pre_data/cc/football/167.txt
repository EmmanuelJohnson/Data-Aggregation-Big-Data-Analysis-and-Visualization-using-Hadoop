Super Bowl ads are often pitched to men. Think cold beer and fast cars.Olay, the skin-care line, will offer a Super Bowl ad for the first time this year. And it is pitched to women.“Olay has always spoken to women and it’s no secret that Super Bowl ads are predominantly male-centric,” Olay brand director Stephanie Robertson told USA TODAY Sports by email. “Research shows that about half of Super Bowl viewers are women, yet only about a quarter of commercials feature women in a starring role.”Olay’s 30-second commercial will run in the first quarter. The creative agency is Saatchi and Saatchi.“We’re hoping to reach women in a historically male-dominated space,” Robertson said, “with an entertaining, unexpected and humorous spot. … We will be disrupting the usual parade of car, snack and beer ads with a message designed to entertain women. Olay wants all women to be bold and empowered, and by featuring a woman as the lead character in our ad campaign this year, we’re hoping to do just that.”Olay is a Procter & Gamble brand. Procter & Gamble turned heads with an ad pitched to women for a different brand in the Super Bowl in 2017. That one styled a dirty-dancing Mr. Clean as an animated domestic sex symbol with the tag line: “You Gotta Love a Man Who Cleans.”More: Jason Bateman's humor, likeability on display in Hyundai's Super Bowl ad
