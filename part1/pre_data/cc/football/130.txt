FOXBOROUGH, Mass. (AP) â€” The daughter of Chargers defensive lineman Brandon Mebane was remembered before Los Angeles' playoff game against the New England Patriots.The Patriots asked fans to stand and observe a moment of silence for Makenna Mebane, who was born with a rare genetic condition known as Trisomy 13 that causes delays in development and affects several organs. She died on Jan. 3 at the age of 7 weeks."We appreciated the Patriots organization," safety Jahleel Addae said after the game on Sunday, which the Chargers lost 42-28. "They're a first-class, stand-up organization to do such a thing; they didn't have to. I know he appreciates it and we appreciate it as well."Brandon Mebane had missed five of the past seven games, including last week's wild-card game at Baltimore, to be with his family. He was active for the divisional playoff round game at New England and had six tackles.Defensive lineman Joey Bosa gave Mebane a big hug after the game."We are dealing with this stuff here which we think is a big deal, and he's dealing with real life problems and real issues," Bosa said. "For him to come back and still be a part of this team means so much to all of us and it means a lot to him, too."___More AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL
