The San Francisco 49ers took a major step in rejuvenating their pass rush.The 49ers agreed to a trade that landed them Dee Ford from the Kansas City Chiefs in change for a 2020 second-round pick, according to The MMQB's Albert Breer. Yahoo Sports' Terez Paylor reported that Ford, who had been on the franchise tag, agreed to a five-year, $87.5 million contract with San Francisco.Ford, 27, is coming off a career year in which he was named to the Pro Bowl after recording 13 sacks. But the Chiefs are set to move to a 4-3 defense under new defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo, and it was unclear where he fit into the team's plans.TRADE: Browns to acquire Odell Beckham Jr. from GiantsFREE AGENCY TRACKER: News, analysis on all of latest moves from TuesdayFord is the second premier pass rusher to be sent out of Kansas City this offseason, as the team also released four-time Pro Bowl outside linebacker Justin Houston.In San Francisco, Ford would join a pass rush that tied for 22nd last year with 37 sacks.
