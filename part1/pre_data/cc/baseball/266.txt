PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. — Tim Tebow is back – and only one step from the majors.The outfielder and former NFL quarterback reported to camp with position players due Saturday, and set to speak to the media. The plan is for Tebow to begin the year in the minors, likely Class AAA, although general manager Brodie Van Wagenen has noted Tebow is only a step away from the majors."We want to get him out there and see some major league pitching," Mets manager Mickey Callaway said Saturday.Tebow hit .273 with a .734 OPS last season with Class AA Binghamton in his second full season in the minors, playing in the Eastern League All-Star Game."I feel for all the young people out there that don’t go after something because they’re so afraid of failing that you’re going to live with a lot more regret than if you tried and you failed," Tebow said Saturday. "I’m very passionate about that.”He suffered a broken bone in his hand in July that held him out for the remainder of the season.
