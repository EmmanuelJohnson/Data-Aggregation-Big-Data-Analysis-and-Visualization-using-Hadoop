Farquhar suddenly collapsed in the dugout after pitching in relief in a game on April 20, but he was rushed to the hospital and survived.He was later discharged on May 7 and was cleared to resume baseball activities in June.Farquhar told MLB.com in November that he thought he could have returned to pitch last season. "I felt like I could have faced big league batters and been just fine," Farquhar said. "I actually had some pretty positive doctors that believed in me. ... They saw my drive the whole way. They thought for sure I'd be back on the field, and now I just have to wait for 2019 for that to happen." Farquhar, 31, is not new to the Yankees' organization. The club claimed him off waivers in June 2012 and was dealt a month later in the trade that brought Ichiro Suzuki to the Yankees.In seven MLB seasons, Farquhar has a 3.93 ERA in 253 appearances with the Mariners, Rays, White Sox and Blue Jays.
