Russell Martin is reuniting with the Los Angeles Dodgers.The four-time All-Star catcher is returning to the organization that drafted him in 2002 in a trade with the Toronto Blue Jays, the clubs announced on Friday.Just a day after losing free agent Yasmani Grandal to the Milwaukee Brewers, the Dodgers countered with Martin for minor league shortstop Ronny Brito and right-handed pitcher Andrew Sopko.Toronto also sent cash to the Dodgers in the deal. Martin will earn $20 million this season and is in final year of a five-year, $82 million contract.Martin, who turns 36 next month, had a down year in 2018, batting a career-low .194 in 90 games. His best years were with the Dodgers from 2006-10 when he hit .272 and helped lead Los Angeles to three postseason appearances.  He is an above-average pitch framer who will likely share duties with Austin Barnes until the arrival Will Smith and/or Keibert Ruiz, each of whom will start the season in the minors.
