Just days away from the official start of spring training, free agent Bryce Harper's meeting with the Giants was confirmed by the club's president of baseball operations Farhan Zaidi."There's obviously mutual interest on both sides, so we thought it made sense to get together," Zaidi said. "We had a good conversation over a few hours and he's obviously got a lot of suitors and a lot of interest."He's going to have some decisions to make, but again I think it's fair to say that was an expression of our interest level to make the trip out there and meet with him."The club met with Harper in his hometown of Las Vegas, news that was accidentally broken by a Giants fan who took a photo with club CEO Larry Baer in the Bellagio hotel earlier in the week."It's kind of hard to deny when your CEO gets made in the casino," Zaidi said Friday.San Francisco went 73-89 in 2018, finishing fourth in the NL West."Having kind of a face-to-face meeting gives you kind of a different level of being able to engage," Zaidi said. "Can't exactly deny that the meeting happened. But beyond that, not really going to have comment on the substance of the meeting beyond that obviously we have interest. You don't make a trip out there to meet with a player just for show."Harper has a history with the Giants, brawling with reliever Hunter Strickland in 2017, a result of bad blood that began in the 2014 NLDS. Strickland is no longer with the team, having signed with the Mariners as a free agent in January.Contributing: Associated PressRULE CHANGES: DH not yet coming to NLMLB 2019: 100 names you need to know
