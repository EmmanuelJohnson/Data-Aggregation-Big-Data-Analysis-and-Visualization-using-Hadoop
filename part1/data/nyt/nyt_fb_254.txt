scientist first reported finding giant mushroom weighed much blue whale sprawled across acre forest michigan upper peninsula alice wonderland type toadstool year old parasitic mold growing tentacle foraged beneath soil root decaying wood devour 
nearly year later scientist using new technology genetic analysis wanted know whether properly measured unusual example fungal life 
made outlandish prediction fungus year old said james anderson retired mycologist emeritus professor university toronto obvious outcome three decade ought still explaining 
recently published uncovered proceeding royal society biological science original humongous fungus armillaria gallica even older bigger first estimated year old parasite spread across acre forest genome harbor mysterious survival strategy extremely low mutation rate 
dr anderson colleague tested soil nearly site peninsula connected dot forest wide canvas painted impressionist portrait monster beneath dirt

first covered space first measured 
second based observation much grew season scientist figured fungus year older originally estimated 
began considering age genetic analysis something seemed strange 
organism grows cell start splitting copying dna mitosis make new identical body cell expect see mutation emerge copy passed one generation next old beast harbored mutation order magnitude lower expected 
two millennium plenty time cell divide copy paste dna send mistake one generation next get mutation fungus must cell division crazy giant fungus made microscopic cell researcher measure many cell division separate bit fungus spanning length nine football field side side measure mutation rate directly huge 
think really interesting result cutting edge technology open new question organism remain stable length time said tom bruns fungal ecologist university california berkeley reviewed study 
dr anderson agree still unclear fungus genome ended way 
paper offer speculation infecting tip fungi rhizome could low rate cell division fungus could really good repairing damage inside cell passing healthy trait onto next generation even bizarrely cell may selective copy dna send next generation maybe combination factor something else entirely dr anderson said 
dr bruns said also possible analysis missed mutation show within big pool cell rare presumed error 
extremely low mutation rate indeed case seems according dr bruns pose interesting question 
widespread among fungi life low mutation rate tell u cancer seems opposite end genetic stability spectrum thing good living win apocalypse cockroach armillaria 
bet armillaria dr bruns said
