wasp navigator year old officer named lt cmdr john greenslade lookout spotted japanese torpedo coming toward wasp greenslade chart house map spread heard shout torpedo starboard bow immediately went outside watched two disappeared sight thundered wasp flank forward stood 
blast forced greenslade back inside chart house formerly tidy office become shamble greenslade gathered map ran forward bridge along several officer debris explosion slammed window superstructure within minute greenslade fellow officer evacuated bridge roasting hot moved back ship time bridge structure soon completely wrecked huge explosion five inch magazine thousand pound bomb housed directly underneath central island evidently one store detonated

board petrel first afternoon mission kraft agonized much trust greenslade position needed sounding board deputy leader wry year old californian named paul mayer bald except fringe gray hair known colleague pop mayer background commercial diving submersible also become historical researcher dry land spends week national archive college park md pulling naval record pinpoint likely place potential target sank mayer plot various position noted official record onto google earth map petrel mayer kraft scour data original document meeting known men speculation club 
petrel sailed eastward honiara along stretch known iron bottom sound concentration world war ii shipwreck relatively shallow water speculation club convened kraft windowless office second deck kraft mayer discussed wasp complicated final movement hit around wasp traveling southeast abandoned point wasp became known dead ship floating without power speculation club believed current pushed moribund wasp west northwest speed one knot around four hour came lansdowne scuttling torpedo wasp finally sank 
mayer kraft worked supposition ship sink straight little variation current left petrel asked lecturer ship technology britannia royal naval college question told deep water least vessel could behave like aerofoil especially picking speed might move significant distance vertical sinking also said process complex dynamic based many unknown factor including air pocket buoyancy asymmetrical nature damage caused ship sink word even knew ship tracked away point sinking underwater change much looked wreck 
besides greenslade reckoning several nearby american ship gave estimate wasp final position data point spanned around mile question trust kraft skeptical much credence give greenslade reckoning least lansdowne navigator marked map mile south spot greenslade noted think kraft said bird feather least go chat navigator lansdowne 
often long period silence speculation club one time men sat foot desk hand cradled trying imagine mind set world war ii navigator one afternoon evening watched friend die seen ship destroyed swum shark still found time note wasp final longitude latitude 
eventually mayer spoke thinking many data point seemed roughly tally greenslade outlier google earth map spot recorded lansdowne navigator way said tapping finger spot southern end map lansdowne navigator said wasp sank 
heard kraft said men laughed 
petrel invited special guest mission amiable retired two star admiral named sam cox lead naval history heritage command washington cox interested cataloging preservation united state navy wreck least shallower water risk damaged bounty hunter raised salvage firm chase value large supply metal cox told wreck united state warship navy equivalent arlington national cemetery accorded similar respect also walking encyclopedia naval history distinct help interpreting original document used petrel find lost ship 
one point speculation club cox stopped kraft office mayer asked position trusted wasp lansdowne 
oh think trust navigator carrier navigator destroyer cox said experience 
soon decision made kraft put yellow pin wanted begin first mission near greenslade spot petrel sight land still day sailing away yellow icon google earth map 
little jan site primed first mission petrel rolled three meter swell ocean inky purplish pink squid jumped near surface light ship cast water giant tuna swam stern 
kraft watched aft deck fat yellow drone rolled hangar cradle white light blinked fin one team jovial shaven headed englishman named scott matthew operated crane fixed port side deck lifted vehicle water designed slightly buoyant order save battery life weight affixed nose dive preprogrammed depth case meter instructed detach weight point engages propeller spiral remaining couple hundred meter bottom vehicle abort reason uncommon occurrence also detaches weight rise surface 
team peered port side yellow drone dived beneath ship blinking light growing fainter disappearing reading sherman report wasp sinking day three torpedo sighted close aboard approaching captain wrote almost immediately ship received three hit watching barrel underneath hull petrel help perceive plangent echo event year ago patch ocean 
crew however pressing concern online room nerve center operation furnished three dozen screen monitor tracking showed vehicle aborted dropped weight returning surface reason sometimes never fully understood even experienced member accepted number factor including obstacle sensed forward facing sonar loss battery programming malfunction could cause drone abort one member told try understand witchcraft added send stuff meter time stuff going go wrong 
two man team dispatched zodiac inflatable fetch recalcitrant drone bobbed flashing surface yard away petrel increasingly swollen sea risky operation especially night affixed zodiac carabiner towed back petrel hauled board reprogrammed sent little time appeared dive went bed woke hour later news aborted midnight crew worked night reprogram 
kraft faced another tough decision weather worsening swell risen maximum five meter big sea cabin sixth deck felt might pitched clean bunk kraft could easily send weather retrieving zodiac might put crew drone risk kraft made call operation delayed ocean flattened 
happen day later hour breakfast jan sent point petrel nautical mile southeast honiara seen another ship two day zodiac dispatched retrieve surfaced next morning humidity stifling seabird flew petrel fish thronged water two three oceanic whitetip shark circled near zodiac 
drone returned cradle deck wire plugged side data retrieved process took around minute team convened online room watch result dive came eric brager bearish dryly comic expert new york explained would looking saw sonar data visualized screen would row looked like mown kansa wheat field seabed perfectly flat sonar image would featureless rocky hill obstruction see shadow known holiday behind outcrop crew looking item inexplicable geology case debris field anomaly would look like collection shiny fleck case whole preserved shipwreck sonar would show looked like toy ship dropped sandbox

hello expletive dolly said rising slightly chair debris 
next minute team would identify two distinct patch debris hundred yard apart kraft seemed excited puppy wreck said one point walking comment back certainly debris looked like promising clue biggest patch within three mile greenslade wasp navigator said ship went kraft asked team run new search south debris field located seemed likely thought wasp would right end debris trail

sock found little debris new grid ship mayer kraft spent thinking go next used two battleship shot 
first mission since paul allen death crew felt absence previous mission kraft emailed billionaire bos least day update allen give praise lightly highest honor kraft could hope receive bos email two word cap cool uncertainty regarding much allen loved petrel liked watch via remote feed team dived new site never doubt member told half joking entertainment business audience one
