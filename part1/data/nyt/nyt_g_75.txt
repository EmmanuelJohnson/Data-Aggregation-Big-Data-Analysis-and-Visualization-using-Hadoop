president trump kim jong un hold summit meeting next week vietnam something common apparently look mirror see nobel peace prize winner 
would war north korea trump tweeted last summer seems see legacy part great peacemaker korean peninsula recently boasted japanese prime minister shinzo abe nominated nobel peace prize 
many people feel way trump told reporter spoke beautiful letter abe written nominate 
abe apparently mortified effort stroke trump become public refused confirm two leading japanese newspaper asahi shimbun yomiuri shimbun reported abe letter written white house request 
surprising symmetry north korea said abuzz talk nobel peace prize possibility could awarded kim kims generally overachiever kim said started driving age father five hole one first game golf mention perfect score first time bowled 
course delusion think either trump kim win nobel peace prize general good thing leader go summit delusional many security official united state abroad worry quest prize trump might make rash pledge withdraw american force south korea 
delusion helpful make side willing make concession pursue arduous peace process think prospect north korea handing nuclear weapon soon possible see diplomatic path leaf world safer fighting chance might achieve 
last year trump bamboozled first meeting kim minimal preparation trump made major concession suspending military exercise exchange nothing significant 
trump compounded diplomatic ineptitude rhetorical grandiosity tweeted longer nuclear threat north korea later asserted kim sent beautiful letter fell love 
fact north korean threat remained indeed north korea apparently continued produce nuclear fuel operate missile base american intelligence official bluntly told senate committee year north korea unlikely denuclearize 
yet trump hoodwinked last year hopeful sign time appointed well respected special envoy stephen biegun biegun trump signaling realistic trade offs timeline trump saying north korea denuclearize ultimately rush 
plausible deal might look like 
north korea would promise dismantle yongbyon nuclear complex couple le important site admit international inspector continue moratorium nuclear missile test exchange united state would relax sanction inter korean project involving tourism manufacturing two side could also declare korean war ended exchange diplomatic liaison office ease cultural exchange agree path forward chipping away nuclear program 
sense kabuki last visit north korea official spoke learning libya give nuclear program america may topple government suspect kim zero plan give nuclear weapon 
even without full denuclearization progress freeze testing halt nuclear production easing tension agreement future step american crossed north korea china last fall north korean expelled rather imprisoned bargaining chip united state likewise eased rule humanitarian aid north korea 
trump kim may claim magical breakthrough perhaps around declaration end korean war believe magic problem solved month year 
best slog pray north korea relation become boring 
greatest threat presidency trump would stumble nuclear war pentagon deeply concerned risk trump kim brinkmanship trump boast nuclear button bigger kim 
kim pursue painstaking peace process instead illusory quest nobel peace prize live
