known writing profile people like tonya harding bradley cooper tool use make sure people forget interview open 
small olympus w recorder think ever forget constantly checking make sure really running volume really like equipment wearing headphone using microphone never ever ever ask anyone speak directly recorder unless extenuating circumstance happened 
people write chaotic schedule probably surprise unexpected interview time tech equipment need ready sudden interview 
basketball game kid dentist appointment suddenly secondary interview kind phone though spoken primary subject phone meeting follow come always olympus one desk work one bag time

never communicate social people writing give card end first meeting put cell onto something forgot tell worried contact 
led lot interaction really made story also helpful ask bradley cooper text kind hat wearing rather go people particularly film promotion time organized time sometimes think ask pertinent question read transcript realize want describe something saw ask room 
people write share story share written social medium generally consider mean 
god hard one think really hard written essentially vulnerable stranger feel bad everyone write tell publication read want really 
someone asks good bad story always say good bad third thing people want stay touch people never want see people hated story
