jeff dachis suddenly unexpectedly learned type diabetes age september stunned ran marathon followed healthy diet never inkling medical trouble previous annual physicals 
went doctor got six minute nurse practitioner insulin pen prescription pat back door mr dachis said terrified idea condition address 
feeling confused scared decided leverage expertise digital marketing technology big data analytics create company one drop help diabetic understand manage disease 
one drop system combine sensor app bluetooth glucose meter track monitor diabetic blood glucose level food exercise medication us artificial intelligence predict person blood glucose level next hour even suggests way person control fluctuation walking exercising offset high sugar level eating candy bar raise low glucose level user also text diabetes coach question real time 
million american living diabetes mr dachis said knew potential market technology big indeed one million people downloaded app date said 
one drop among surging number company using internet thing also known iot technology create new treatment health care sector 
advance like robotics nanotechnology genetic engineering printing artificial intelligence iot fueling exciting era within health care innovation said jeff becker senior analyst health care expert forrester many effort undoubtedly fall flat could end transformative ray 
consumer paying attention 
percent consumer surveyed united state said technology important managing health according report accenture 
latest tech related medical treatment advance run gamut implant help paralyzed people walk smart pill detect patient fail take medication 
spinal cord research took major step forward year old man paralyzed chest since snowmobile accident able walk distance football field help rolling walker milestone published nature medicine last fall came team researcher mayo clinic implanted epidural electrical stimulator device man lower spine gave six month intensive physical therapy 
revolutionary breakthrough said kendall lee neurosurgeon director neural engineering laboratory mayo clinic said device far successfully implanted two people 
implant cure offer hope million paralyzed people around world dr lee careful note technology still time away publicly available 
able study investigational device exemption dr lee said something general population yet

smart pill world health organization estimated percent people chronic disease developed country fail take medicine prescribed whether forgetfulness concern side effect reason 
noncompliance cost health care system united state billion billion year emergency room visit hospital stay cost related worsening medical condition according network excellence health innovation 
adheretech built smart pill bottle alert patient time take medication sends automated text phone message miss dose real time track use content bottle definitive way detect whether person actually swallowed pill 
pharmaceutical maker otsuka go step worked proteus digital health create digital smart pill otsuka abilify medication used treat schizophrenia bipolar disorder depression abilify mycite pill rolled next month embedded sensor activated stomach acid sensor tracked patch worn person stomach sends information smartphone app patient doctor track medication taken even send notification 
technology go far beyond pill taking reminder said andrew thompson co founder president chief executive proteus digital health sensor patch also track physical activity heart rate rest pattern metric help doctor patient know whether medication working right dose prescribed 
abilify mycite pill come cheap cost month significantly month cost generic version abilify pill however patient would take digital pill two three month enough time collect data pill taking adherence dosage health impact revise treatment plan andrew wright otsuka vice president digital medicine said 
effort underway proteus otsuka add technology pill chronic condition mr thompson belief future 
year grandchild child incredulous put thing body know real fake right dose wrong dose date date mr thompson said yes eventually every drug everywhere 
world prosthetics scientist found way tetraplegics paralyzed neck feel touch electrically stimulating part brain paralysis mean loss control feeling affected area prosthetics return motor function sensing requires treatment nervous system 
initially challenge seemed daunting considering brain contains billion neuron matching neuron control sensory nerve prosthetic hand arm tough said sliman bensmaia associate professor department organismal biology anatomy university chicago part research team surgically placing electrode implant brain team able electrically stimulate portion brain controlled sensation allowing patient feel size shape texture object tell finger touched 
plan work expand human trial university pittsburgh john hopkins university university chicago biggest challenge making brain implant wireless upgrading wear five year 
brain surgery every year dr bensmaia said need array implant technology last lifetime 
dr bensmaia said brain implant technology could someday far reaching application improving memory retrieving information faster 
another hot area use printer create patient specific medical device like knee joint spinal implant printer make faster easier cheaper make customized medical device based patient scan 
made one fifth one tenth time traditional custom made device made said scott hollister professor department biomedical engineering georgia institute technology emory university printed device often fit far better cause fewer complication require shorter recovery period shelf joint replacement come size small medium large 
least printed device received approval although use largely confined academic research hospital 
many breakthrough technology shown promise clinical trial expert caution guarantee ever make market 
mr becker forrester analyst cited disastrous example theranos made false claim year revolutionary blood testing technology required small amount blood company raised million valued billion peak made founder elizabeth holmes billionaire collapsing scientist regulator discovered technology work

google lab called verily unveiled news much fanfare developing smart contact lens could monitor blood glucose level real time measuring tear fluid eye company partner project novartis said expected device store shelf within five year 
huge news holy grail life science something everybody wanted first bring market mr becker said 
waited update nothing came radio silence last november company announced project scrapped inconsistent testing result 
clearly science mr becker said prematurely announced got excited made big splash naught
