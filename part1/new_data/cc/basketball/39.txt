LOS ANGELES — Blake Griffin is all business in pregame warmups.
There’s not a lot of time for chit-chat – even for his former employer.
The Detroit Pistons star – preparing to face the Los Angeles Clippers for the first time at Staples Center since being traded a year ago – didn’t make time to speak with Clippers owner Steve Ballmer, who was waiting for Griffin to conclude his warmup routine.
The Athletic’s Jovan Buha reported the development Saturday about an hour before the Pistons try to stop a four-game losing skid against a top Western Conference team.
Shortly after the scene witnessed by Buha, the Detroit Free Press witnessed Griffin sprint through a Staples Center hallway and into the visitor’s locker room – part of his normal routine.
But emotions are running high since it’s no secret Griffin disliked how after signing him to a five-year, $171-million contract, calling him a “Clipper for Life,” he was traded to the Pistons months later.
Pistons coach Dwane Casey noted the similarities when he returned to Toronto this season – a night that was victorious for the Pistons against the franchise that fired Casey last offseason.
“I feel it,” Casey said before the game. “I want to come in here for him and do everything we can possibly do to get him a win because it means a lot.
“You always have a little extra when you go back to where you came from – whether they traded you or not.”
