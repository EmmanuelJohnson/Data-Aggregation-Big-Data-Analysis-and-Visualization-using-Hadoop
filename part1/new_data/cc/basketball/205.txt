Rumors that James Dolan is potentially interested in selling the New York Knicks have been circulating, and The Ringer's Bill Simmons has now added more fuel to that fire. 
Citing people "who know things," Simmons on his podcast said that he was told Dolan is courting offers.
"It's happening," Simmons said. "It's on. It's go-time. He's courting offers for the Knicks. That's what I heard at All-Star weekend from people I trust."
Simmons believes Dolan is more interested in running the company's entertainment division. 
But a statement released Monday by The Madison Square Garden Company, of which Dolan is chairman and CEO, denied all accounts of the report.
“The story is 100% false," the statement reads. "There has been nothing. No discussions. No plans to have discussions - nothing.”
In an interview with ESPN's Ian O'Connor in December, Dolan said he wouldn't rule out selling the Knicks, mainly because he has a responsibility to his shareholders of the publicly traded company.
"They're not there because they're fans," Dolan said in the interview. "You don't invest hundreds of millions of dollars in a stock because you're a fan. You do it because you think that the business is going to increase in value, that the stock price is going to go up. You have a responsibility as the guy who runs the place to deliver on that for them, that's being open and transparent. And so in that position, I could never say that I wouldn't consider selling the Knicks."
Dolan said he had gotten feelers that had reached as much as $5 billion, but there were no "bona fide" offers.
Shortly after the interview was released, the Garden released a statement denying Dolan would sell.
"As we have previously stated, there are no plans to sell the Knicks," the statement said. 
The speculation, however, persists.
