MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) â€” Memphis Grizzlies guard/forward Dillon Brooks is expected to miss the remainder of the season because of a ruptured ligament in his right big toe.
The Grizzlies announced that Brooks underwent surgery Friday. The Grizzlies said Brooks should have a full recovery in time for the 2019-20 training camp.
Brooks, 22, appeared in 18 games this season off the bench and averaged 7.5 points, 1.7 rebounds and 18.3 minutes.
The 6-foot-6, 220-pound Brooks, a former second-round pick from Oregon, was the only Memphis player to play in all 82 games last season. The Grizzlies acquired Brooks immediately after the Houston Rockets selected him with the 45th overall selection in the 2017 draft.
Brooks made 74 starts his rookie year and averaged 11 points, 3.1 rebounds and 28.7 minutes.
