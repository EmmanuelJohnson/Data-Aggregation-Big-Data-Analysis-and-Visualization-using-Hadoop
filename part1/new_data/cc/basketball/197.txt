CHARLOTTE, N.C. — More than bragging rights will be at stake when Stephen Curry and Seth Curry compete Saturday night in the 3-point shooting contest during the NBA’s All-Star Game weekend festivities.
The brothers have wagered on the outcome.
“Family’s obviously big for us, like support, so we kind of wanted to weave that into the bet,’’ Stephen Curry said. “So whoever loses has to pick up the tab for all the tickets anytime we play against each other for the rest of our careers.
“The stakes are high considering how many people show up for our games. So I got to get the best of him tonight. I know he’s very confident.’’
Any message he’d like the media to relay to his younger brother?
“All I can tell him is hopefully he got a good night’s sleep last night,’’ Curry. “That’s about it. (But) there’s no such thing as sleep when we come back to Charlotte for All-Star weekend. That’s why I say I got to have that Energizer Bunny mentality.’’
Neither of the brothers likely will top their mom’s feat on Friday, when Sonya Curry made a underhanded, half-court shot to win a family shooting competition.
Pandemonium followed at Carole Hoefner Center, where the Curry family gathered to celebrate their refurbishing the facility.
“I was like wham, bam, canahan, that’s going in,’’ Stephen Curry said. “And so it was just exciting for the whole family to be there. … And her celebration game was nice.’’
