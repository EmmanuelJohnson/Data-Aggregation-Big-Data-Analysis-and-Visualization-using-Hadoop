A little over three months ago, nine-year-old Riley Morrison wrote a letter to Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry asking why his shoe company didn't have a model for girls.
Curry wrote back, indicating he'd try to do something about it. 
"I was immediately impressed when I saw Riley's letter; that a nine year old girl had the courage to use her voice to call attention to an issue and keep us accountable. She was focused on the opportunity for ALL girls, not just herself," Curry said.
"She's been an amazing catalyst for change — not only with my product but also with the entire Under Armour brand. She is inspiring, and wise beyond her years."
With the arrival of International Women's Day on Friday, the Curry 6 "United We Win" shoe by Under Armour makes its debut. 
The company says the new shoes will be a blend of purple and deep orchid with white. In addition, they will come with a sock liner Riley helped design — with two girls playing basketball, surrounded by the words "Be Fearless," "Girl Power," "Be the Change," "Girls Hoop Too" and "Rock the Currys."
On Thursday, one day before the official release, Curry surprised Riley with her own pair of the Curry 6 shoes she helped design. 
Proceeds from sales of the new United We Win shoes will go toward a scholarship that the Stephen and Ayesha Curry Family Foundation and Under Armour have created for college-bound female students in the Bay Area.
