ALAMEDA, Calif. (AP) â€” The Oakland Raiders have signed receiver J.J. Nelson and defensive lineman Josh Mauro.
The Raiders also re-signed exclusive rights free agent linebacker Jason Cabinda and unrestricted free agent guard Chaz Green on Friday.
Nelson spent his first four seasons with Arizona after being drafted on the fifth round in 2015. He had 81 catches for 1,439 yards and 10 TDs in 56 games. Nelson adds speed to the group, having been clocked at 4.28 seconds in the 40-yard dash at the combine and averaging 17.8 yards per catch for his career, the highest in that span for any player with at least 80 receptions.
Mauro has experience playing all over the line and is strong against the run. He has three sacks in 59 career games with Arizona and the Giants.
Cabinda had 21 tackles in 10 games as a rookie last season.
Green played four games for Oakland with one start. He previously had played for Dallas and New Orleans.
