BALTIMORE (AP) â€” Former Baltimore Ravens running back Alex Collins is out on bond after being charged with drug and gun violations.
Collins was arrested after an early-morning car crash Friday and subsequently cut by the Ravens. The single-car accident occurred near Baltimore's training complex in Owings Mills, Maryland.
Collins has been charged with possession of marijuana, possession with intent to distribute and having a handgun in a vehicle. He was released on $7,500 posted bond following an initial bail hearing shortly after midnight Saturday morning.
The 24-year-old Collins led Baltimore with 973 yards rushing in 2017 and scored eight touchdowns in 2018 before a foot injury ended his season in late November.
Rookie Gus Edwards took over and led the Ravens with 718 yards rushing.
Collins was a restricted free agent before his release. If not claimed on waivers, he becomes a free agent.
