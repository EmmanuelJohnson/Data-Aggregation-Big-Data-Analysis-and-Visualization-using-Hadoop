Steve Spurrier returned to the sidelines Saturday night for his coaching debut in the new Alliance of American Football. And it was almost like he never left. 
Spurrier, 73, showed off a freewheeling offense as his Orlando Apollos rolled to a 40-6 win over the Atlanta Legends — and he was as cantankerous as ever in his postgame comments. 
When asked about winning his sixth consecutive opener with a new team, the famed "Head Ball Coach" couldn't resist taking a shot at one of his former employers.
"Even won with the Redskins,” Spurrier said, laughing. “That’s not easy to do.”
The former Heisman Trophy winner at the University of Florida generated plenty of buzz in Orlando, where 20,191 fans turned out to see the kind of wide-open offense that was his trademark while coaching at his alma mater.
“I think the fans had a good time,” he said. “They saw enough good plays, especially after the first quarter.”
Included among those good plays: a version of the "Philly Special" the Philadelphia Eagles used to win Super Bowl LII, a double-reverse pass to the quarterback for a touchdown.
Perhaps the only thing that didn't live up to expectations was Spurrier's attire.
The intermittent rain that fell forced the Ball Coach to wear a ball cap — instead of his signature visor.
