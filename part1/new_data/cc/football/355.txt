ASHBURN, Va. – Jack Gruden, the son of Washington Redskins head coach Jay Gruden and a video assistant with the team, was arrested on suspicion of being drunk in public after he was involved in multiple confrontations at a shopping and dining area near Redskins Park early Saturday morning.
Gruden, 22, got into an argument around 2:15 a.m. ET Saturday and "walked after the other male to continue the confrontation," the Loudoun County (Va.) Sheriff's Department said in a statement provided to USA TODAY Sports and other outlets. 
"The deputy then intervened and the two parties were separated," the statement read. "Gruden was later involved in two additional confrontations with customers in the area."
Gruden was booked and released from the Loudoun County Adult Detention Center. He's scheduled to appear in a Leesburg, Va., courtroom on March 21, according to online court records. 
“We are aware of the arrest of Jack Gruden," Redskins spokesperson Tony Wyllie said in a statement to USA TODAY Sports. "We are gathering more information and will not comment until we have further details.” 
The incident occurred about a block from where Redskins safety Montae Nicholson was arrested on suspicion of assault and battery and public drunkenness in December. Coincidentally, Gruden was arrested feet from the since-shuttered Hail and Hog, a Redskins-themed bar that closed in August 2017. 
WRC-TV was the first outlet to report the arrest.
