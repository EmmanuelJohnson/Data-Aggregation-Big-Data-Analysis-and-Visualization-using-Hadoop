NEW YORK (AP) â€” Chicago safety Adrian Amos has been fined $26,739 by the NFL for his unnecessary roughness penalty in the Bears' playoff loss to the Philadelphia Eagles.
Amos hit tight end Zach Ertz, who was deemed a defenseless receiver, in the third quarter of Philadelphia's 16-15 win last Sunday. It came on a third-down play that extended the drive that gave the Eagles a 10-6 lead on Dallas Goedert's 10-yard touchdown catch.
Eagles defensive lineman Bennett was docked $10,026 on Saturday, also for unnecessary roughness, for an open-handed punch to the face of Bears offensive lineman Kyle Long's face in the second quarter. It was also a third-down play that extended a drive, and Chicago kicked a field goal a few plays later.
