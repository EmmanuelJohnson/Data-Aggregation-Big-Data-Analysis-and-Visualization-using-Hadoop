Jim Kelly was having another surgery Saturday — this time on his back.
“Surgery after surgery. Battle after battle,” his daughter Erin Kelly Bean wrote on Instagram.
In her own Instagram post, Kelly’s wife, Jill, explained that a cyst pushing against the Hall of Fame quarterback’s spinal cord needs to be removed. 
“Maybe you’re thinking what I’m thinking...not another surgery,” she continued. “I know. Another mountain to climb. But...also, another opportunity to trust God and walk by faith.”
It’s been nearly a year since Kelly, the former Buffalo Bills legend, had major surgery on his upper jaw to treat a recurrence of oral squamous-cell carcinoma, which was first diagnosed in May 2013.
Last September, Kelly had reconstructive surgery so that dentures could be placed.
In January, Jill Kelly reported on Instagram that an MRI scan showed no evidence of cancer.
