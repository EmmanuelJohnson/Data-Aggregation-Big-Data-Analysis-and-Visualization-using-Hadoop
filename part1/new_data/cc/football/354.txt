EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) â€” The New York Giants have hired Mike Dawson and Henry Baker as assistant coaches for the defense.
In announcing the additions Monday, the Giants said Dawson will be the outside linebackers coach, while Baker will be the team's assistant defensive backs coach.
Baker replaces Deshea Townsend, who was recently hired as the Chicago Bears' defensive backs coach. Dawson replaces Rob Leonard, who left to become the Miami Dolphins' linebackers coach. Dawson spent the previous three seasons as a defensive line coach under Scott Frost at Central Florida and Nebraska.
Dawson was on the Eagles' coaching staff from 2013-15, the three seasons Giants coach Pat Shurmur was Philadelphia's offensive coordinator. Dawson also coached at Boston College, Akron and New Hampshire. He was a three-year starter at linebacker and defensive end at UMass.
Baker comes to the Giants from Rutgers, where he returned on Jan. 2 as cornerbacks coach and passing game coordinator. He spent the 2018 season at North Carolina as cornerbacks coach - the position he held at Rutgers in 2017.
Baker also worked at Delaware, East Stroudsburg and Maryland, his alma mater.
