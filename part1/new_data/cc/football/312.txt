The lowest-scoring Super Bowl in history was also the least-watched NFL title game in a decade. 
Super Bowl LIII averaged 100.7 million viewers with streaming factored in, CBS Sports announced Monday evening. The New England Patriots' 13-3 victory against the Los Angeles Rams was viewed by about 3 percent fewer people than last year's Super Bowl (103 million) and was well off the most-watched Super Bowl (114 million) set in February 2015 (Patriots vs. Seattle Seahawks). 
Super Bowl XLIII – which featured the Pittsburgh Steelers against the Arizona Cardinals in February 2009 – was the last NFL title game to not reach an average of 100 million viewers.

CBS managed to clear the 100 million threshold, thanks to record streaming viewership.
The game had an average streaming audience of 2.6 million viewers, a 31 percent improvement from last year's game broadcast on NBC. 
Viewers used 7.5 million unique devices (a gain of more than 20 percent from Super Bowl LII) and watched more than 560 million total minutes of live game coverage (a rise  of more than 19 percent), according to CBS Sports.
