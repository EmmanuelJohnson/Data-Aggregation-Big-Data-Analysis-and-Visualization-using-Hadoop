In a poll conducted by The Athletic over the past six weeks, 95 percent of defensive players interviewed said they believe Colin Kaepernick should be on an NFL roster.
Kaepernick, who was the first player to kneel during the national anthem as a means of protesting police brutality and racial inequality, last played in the NFL during the 2016 season. He filed a collusion grievance against NFL owners in Oct. 2017.
Eighty-five defensive players anonymously participated in The Athletic's survey, according to the web site, of which 81 said Kaepernick deserves a roster spot. Two players voted "no" to that question, and two more declined to comment, according to The Athletic.
In response to another question about which active quarterback Kaepernick deserves to replace, several players indicated that the former San Francisco 49er is worthy of a backup job, and three said specifically that he would be a backup if signed.
The Athletic said players from 25 different teams participated in its poll but did not specify which teams were not represented, nor how the participants were selected.
Despite his choice to largely eschew interview requests over the past year, Kaepernick's absence from the NFL has remained in the public eye, buoyed by active players like Carolina Panthers safety Eric Reid, who has openly campaigned for Kaepernick to return to the league. Nike also featured Kaepernick in an advertising campaign in September with the slogan "Believe in something, even if it means sacrificing everything."
