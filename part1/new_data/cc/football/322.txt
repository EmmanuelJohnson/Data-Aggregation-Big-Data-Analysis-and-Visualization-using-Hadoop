MIAMI (AP) — Former Colts and Lions coach Jim Caldwell has been hired by new Dolphins coach Brian Flores as assistant head coach and quarterbacks coach.
Caldwell was among 16 members of Flores' staff announced Friday. The group includes new offensive coordinator Chad O'Shea and defensive coordinator Patrick Graham, both former Patriots assistants.
Flores joined the Patriots in 2004 and was the defensive play-caller for this season's Super Bowl championship team. He became the Dolphins' coach on Monday.
Also joining Flores' staff are Danny Crossman as special teams coordinator, Josh Boyer as defensive pass game coordinator and cornerbacks coach, Karl Dorrell as receivers coach, Pat Flaherty as offensive line coach, George Godsey as tight ends coach, Marion Hobby as defensive line coach, Rob Leonard as linebackers coach, Tony Oden as safeties coach, Jerry Schuplinski as assistant quarterbacks coach and Eric Studesville as running backs coach.
O'Shea, Boyer and Schuplinski worked for the Patriots this past season.
Flores hired three quality control coaches — Josh Grizzard, Matt Lombardi and Tiquan Underwood. Oden, Studesville and Grizzard were retained from Adam Gase's 2018 Miami staff.
Caldwell has 17 years of NFL coaching experience. In his seven seasons as head coach of the Colts (2009-11) and Lions (2014-17), he led teams to four playoff berths.
Caldwell also won two Super Bowls as an assistant coach with the Colts and Ravens.
"Jim is an incredible human being, a man of faith and a great football coach," Flores said in a statement. "His experience as a head coach will be invaluable for me. Jim is a great teacher, highly organized and somebody that I have a lot of respect for."
