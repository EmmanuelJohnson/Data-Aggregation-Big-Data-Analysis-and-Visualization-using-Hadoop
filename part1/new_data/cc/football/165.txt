Serena Williams, who is starring in the Australian Open now, will be starring in a Super Bowl ad come Feb. 3.
Williams will appear in an ad for Bumble, a dating and networking app where women, according to the company, “make the first move — in life, in love, in business.”
The ad campaign is called “The Ball is in Her Court” and the company styles Williams as “the ultimate first mover.”
“In my life, I can confidently say that I would not be where I am today had I let the fear of making the first move hold me back,” Williams said in a statement.
Bumble says it has more than 47 million users worldwide. The brand earlier announced a partnership with Williams that goes active on Super Sunday. Williams will serve as Bumble’s global ambassador to reinforce what it calls its “mission to end misogyny and empower women around the world.”
Whitney Wolfe Herd, company founder and CEO, said partnering with Williams has been a dream of hers since Bumble began just over four years ago.
“Bumble has evolved into the only woman-first, global social networking platform for love, friendship, and professional networking,” she said in a statement, calling Williams “a shining example of someone making the first move in all facets of her life.”
Williams, the 23-time Grand Slam champion, defeated Tatjana Maria of Germany 6-0, 6-2 in the first round of the Australian Open on Tuesday.
“Every single one of us holds the power to write our own stories,” Williams said in her statement. “I look at my daughter and know it is my duty to pave a powerful path for her, and as Bumble’s global advisor, I can encourage her and women everywhere to think like a champion, define their lives and ultimately, embrace the power we have within.”
