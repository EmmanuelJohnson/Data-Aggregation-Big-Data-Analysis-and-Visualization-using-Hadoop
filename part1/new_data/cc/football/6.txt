Although two doors slammed shut on the Cardinals early on in their search for a new head coach when both Mike McCarthy and Eric Bieniemy turned down requests for an interview, another door opened on Monday when it was learned Kliff Kingsbury now will be allowed to meet with Arizona, after all.
Kingsbury, the former Texas Tech head coach, had been denied permission to meet with NFL teams by USC, where he has been employed since early December as the Trojans’ offensive coordinator.
In what was believed to be an unprecedented move by USC atheltic director Lynn Swann, Kingsbury wasn’t allowed to talk to either the Cardinals or the Jets, who each had sought permission to interview him for their vacant head coaching positions.
Multiple reports surfaced early Monday afternoon, however, that Swann has changed his stance and is permitting Kingsbury to explore any and all available head coaching jobs in the NFL. Apparently, there is mutual interest between Kingsbury and the Cardinals and an interview could happen relatively soon.
According to The Athletic's Bruce Feldman, Kingsbury met with the Jets on Monday about their coaching vacancy. The Cardinals may not be far behind.
Monday marked one week since Steve Wilks and his assistants, including coordinators Byron Leftwich and Al Holcomb, were fired by the Cardinals following a 3-13 season.
Arizona has already interviewed four head coaching candidates in former Dolphins head coach Adam Gase, former Colts and Lions head coach Jim Caldwell, Saints assistant head coach/tight ends coach Dan Campbell and Rams quarterbacks coach Zac Taylor.
Despite three straight losing seasons and a 35-40 overall record in six seasons at Texas Tech, his alma mater, Kingsbury has become a hot commodity around the NFL. Some teams are viewing him as an ideal offensive coordinator, including the Patriots, who may be on the lookout for a new OC if and when Josh McDaniels leaves to accept a head coaching position.
