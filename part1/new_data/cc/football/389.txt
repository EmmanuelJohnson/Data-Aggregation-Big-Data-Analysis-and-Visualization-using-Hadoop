DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. – New England Patriots receiver Julian Edelman will be the honorary starter for Sunday’s Daytona 500, an honor that typically has gone to Hall of Fame-caliber athletes and celebrities over the years. 
Edelman was the MVP of Super Bowl LIII earlier this month as the Patriots defeated the Los Angeles Rams. Pro Football Hall of Fame players Troy Aikman, Jim Kelly, Ken Stabler, Brett Favre, Dan Marino, Terry Bradshaw, Ray Lewis and LaDainian Tomlinson have been honorary starters here. 
“Julian Edelman is an incredible addition to the list of pre-race dignitaries for the DAYTONA 500,” Daytona International Speedway President Chip Wile said in a statement. “We’re honored to have such a superb athlete, who recently won on NFL’s biggest stage and was the Super Bowl MVP, wave the green flag for NASCAR’s premier event.”
The news release that announced the honor did not mention that Edelman served a four-game suspension at the start of the 2018 NFL regular season for violating the NFL’s policy on performance-enhancing drugs. 
Such a ban would have been longer in sports where other honorary starters have competed over the years.
For example, U.S. Olympic snowboarders Hannah Teter and Gretchen Bleiler – who were co-honorary starters in 2006 – and U.S. Olympic soccer player Abby Wambach, an honorary starter in 2015, come from sports that abide by the Word Anti-Doping Code where a first-time offense can lead to up to four-year ban. 
Edelman joins J.J. Watt, who is the grand marshal.
