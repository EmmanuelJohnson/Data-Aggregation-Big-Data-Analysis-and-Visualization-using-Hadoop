President Donald Trump had sports on the mind Sunday night, as shortly after he tweeted his congratulations to the New England Patriots for reaching the Super Bowl he sent another tweet supporting the Baseball Hall of Fame candidacy of retired pitcher Curt Schilling. 
The 52-year-old Schilling, a former star for the Philadelphia Phillies, Arizona Diamondbacks and Boston Red Sox who retired following the 2007 season, was appearing on Mark Levin's show on Fox News. 
"Curt Schilling deserves to be in the Baseball Hall of Fame. Great record, especially when under pressure and when it mattered most. Do what everyone in Baseball knows is right!" Trump wrote on Twitter. 
As Trump noted, Schilling was the ultimate big-game pitcher, posting an 11-2 postseason record and 2.23 ERA while helping his teams to three World Series championships. Schilling finished his career with 216 regular-season wins and a 3.46 ERA pitching largely in the heart of baseball's Steroid Era. 
But as USA TODAY Sports' Ted Berg outlines, Schilling's exclusion from the Hall of Fame to this point may have more to do with things he said and did online than what he accomplished on the baseball diamond. 
Schilling was fired from his analyst role at ESPN in 2016 for an anti-transgender post put on his Facebook page. Prior to his firing he had received a suspension in 2015 for sharing a post on Twitter that compared Muslims to the Nazis. 
It was also in 2016 that Schilling jokingly endorsed the lynching of journalists, a move that Berg notes has caused some writers to leave Schilling off their Hall of Fame ballots. 
Schilling appeared to appreciate Trump's words and also re-iterated his support for the president, writing "Thank you Mr President! Do NOT give in on any of it! We are behind you!"
