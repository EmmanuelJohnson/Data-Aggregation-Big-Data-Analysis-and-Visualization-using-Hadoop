The Milwaukee Brewers have made it clear: They would prefer the least amount of Chicago Cubs fans to fill Miller Park as possible. 
In a statement released Wednesday, the Brewers announced presale tickets for their 10 home dates against the Cubs, tickets that will only initially be made available to residents of Wisconsin.
"If last season's Game 163 taught us anything, it's that every single game matters - especially in a rivalry like this. And, while we don't dislike all Cubs fans, we just really prefer when Miller Park is packed to the brim with Brewers faithful," the team's statement read.
"So, we're calling upon all Wisconsinites to fill up Miller Park every time the Cubs come to town this season... This is your chance to grab your seat early for 10 of the season's biggest games and keep Cubs fans where they belong – comfortably at home – in the process. How about that for a 2-for-1?"
This isn't a new ticket approach for the Brewers, who could be poised to see another attendance gain following their strong finish in 2018. Milwaukee, powered by MVP Christian Yelich, captured the NL Central title by winning Game No. 163 in Chicago last fall and advanced all the way to Game 7 of the NLCS before falling to the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
The success of this particular plan to keep Cubs fans out, though, will likely be mixed. As Yahoo! pointed out, there will be plenty of Cubs fans who live in Wisconsin who will be able to get their hand on presale tickets. Additionally, Cubs fans — one of the biggest groups of fandom in MLB — will likely have no problem picking up tickets on the re-sale market. 
Still, it's a fun way to stoke the flames of what should be one of baseball's best rivalries this season.
