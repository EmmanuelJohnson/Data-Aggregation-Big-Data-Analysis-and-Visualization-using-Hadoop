After winning 108 games and their fourth World Series title in 15 years, you might assume the Boston Red Sox would be the clear favorite again heading into the 2019 season. 
Alas, that's not how life goes in the American League East.
Victimized in an AL Division Series by their biggest rivals after a 100-win season of their own, the New York Yankees went out and dramatically improved this winter.
In their quest for a 28th championship, the Yankees traded for starter James Paxton, added three-time Gold Glove winner and 2016 batting champion DJ LeMahieu to the infield mix and bolstered the already-dominant bullpen with the signing of Adam Ottavino.
Meanwhile, Boston largely stood pat. The club retained the services of World Series heroes Nathan Eovaldi and Steve Pearce, but the Red Sox haven't (yet) brought back closer Craig Kimbrel and it's unlikely the team's opening-day roster will have a single new player.
The next six months will tell if the Yankees can claim their first division title since 2012, but New York starts the 2019 season atop the USA TODAY Sports' power rankings, as voted on by a panel of eight writers and editors:
