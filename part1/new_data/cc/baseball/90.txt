ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) â€” The Texas Rangers have avoided arbitration with outfielders Nomar Mazara and Delino DeShields by agreeing to 2019 contracts.
Mazara, the 23-year-old slugger already with three 20-homer seasons, will make $3.3 million and DeShields will get $1.4 million. Both made about $550,000 last season.
The Rangers haven't had to go to a salary arbitration hearing since 2000 with first baseman/designated hitter Lee Stevens.
Mazara hit .258 with 20 homers and 77 RBIs in 128 games last season, when he missed a month because of a sprained right thumb. He didn't homer in his last 22 games after returning from the disabled list.
DeShields hit .216 with 20 stolen bases in 106 games last season, when he had three DL stints. He led MLB in bunt hits (12) and sacrifice bunts (12) for the second season in a row.
