If added to the 40-man roster, the 35-year-old Rosales would get a one-year contract paying a $1 million salary while in the major leagues.
Rosales hit .211 in 13 games for Cleveland last year. He is a career .226 hitter with 48 home runs and 179 RBIs in 11 years with Cincinnati, Oakland, Texas, San Diego, Arizona and Cleveland.
