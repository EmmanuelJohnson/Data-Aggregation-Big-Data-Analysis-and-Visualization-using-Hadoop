Major League Baseball has no plans to adopt a universal DH before the 2022 season, two officials with direct knowledge of the decision, told USA TODAY Sports after the completion of their owners’ meetings in Orlando, Fla.
The news comes to the relief of many National League clubs and their fanbases, who are adamantly opposed to implementing a DH for the first time in their league.
“It’s not happening during this CBA,’’ one official told USA TODAY Sports.
The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the talks.
The current Collective Bargaining Agreement expires in December, 2021.
The proposal was submitted last week by the Major League Baseball Players Association to counter MLB’s proposals of a pitch clock and other ideas of speeding up the game.
“Those are significant economic issues,’’ MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said at his news conference in Orlando, Fla. “They are different than the type of playing rule changes that we have out there. We will engage on these issues, but they came with a much broader agenda.”
