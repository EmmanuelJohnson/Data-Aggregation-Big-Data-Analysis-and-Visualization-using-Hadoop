Mel Stottlemyre, an All-Star pitcher and one of baseball's top pitching coaches for two decades, died at the age of 77 after a long battle with bone marrow cancer, the Yankees confirmed to USA TODAY Sports on Monday.
Stottlemyre spent his entire playing career with the Yankees, winning 164 games from 1964-1974. He won 20 games three times and was a five-time All-Star.
After his playing days ended, Stottlemyre became one of the league's most highly-regarded coaches. He joined the Mets as a pitching coach for the 1984 season and spent 10 years with the organization, winning the World Series in 1986. 
Stottlemyre spent 1994 and 1995 with the Astros before returning to the Bronx. He served as the Yankees' pitching coach from 1996-2005, overseeing a staff that won four World Series titles (1996, 1998-2000) and made the playoffs every season he was there.
"He was more than a great pitcher and fantastic pitching coach," former Mets and Yankees pitcher David Cone said on Twitter. "He was a father figure and touched so many in a positive way."
Stottlemyre announced in 1999 that he had been diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a cancer in the blood marrow. He was honored with a plaque in Monument Park at Yankee Stadium in 2015.
Stottlemyre had two sons who played in the majors – Todd and Mel Jr. Todd pitched for five clubs from 1988-2002, while Mel Jr. pitched for the Royals in 1990. Mel Jr. became a pitching coach himself, and he was hired in December by the Marlins after three seasons with the Mariners.
“Beyond his tremendous accomplishments as a player and coach, Mel Stottlemyre was beloved for his class, dignity and fighting spirit," Yankees owner Hal Steinbrenner said in a statement Monday.
"His contributions to different eras in our history guided us through difficult times and brought us some of our greatest all-time success. As a result, Mel’s popularity transcended generations, all of whom thought of him as their own. His plaque in Monument Park will forever serve to celebrate the significance of his legacy."
