As full-squad workouts get underway in Florida and Arizona with top free agents still unsigned, Major League Baseball Players Association executive director Tony Clark issued a scathing statement in response to commissioner Rob Manfred's comments Sunday.
"Players’ eyes don’t deceive them, and nor do fans'," Clark said in a statement Monday. "As players report to spring training and see respected veterans and valued teammates on the sidelines, they are rightfully frustrated by a two-year attack on free agency." 
During a press conference in Florida on Sunday, Manfred blamed Clark for claiming last spring that certain teams weren't trying to win – a sentiment that has been echoed by plenty of players over the past year.
Clark stuck to his guns Monday and made it clear he still feels that way.
"Players commit to compete every pitch of every at-bat, and every inning of every game," Clark said. "Yet we’re operating in an environment in which an increasing number of clubs appear to be making little effort to improve their rosters, compete for a championship or justify the price of a ticket."
Manfred had tried to paint a brighter picture a day earlier, hinting that nothing is really wrong and it's merely a perception based on negative media coverage.
“I hate the negativity that surrounds the coverage of the game right now,” Manfred said Sunday. “Probably the best antidote for that is to get out there and start playing the game. I think once we get out and start playing the game, the glow of positivity will reemerge.”
