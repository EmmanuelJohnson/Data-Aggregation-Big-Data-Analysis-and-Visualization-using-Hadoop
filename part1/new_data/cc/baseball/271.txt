MESA, Ariz. — Manny Machado, one of the biggest prizes on the free agent market, has finally received a contract proposal that may suit his demands.
The San Diego Padres submitted an eight-year offer to Machado worth between $240 million and $280 million – which is heavily deferred – two people with knowledge of the talks told USA TODAY Sports. 
The people spoke on the condition of anonymity because negotiations are ongoing
Machado is also in talks with the Chicago White Sox and Philadelphia Phillies.
The 26-year-old Machado hit .297 with 37 homers last season for the Baltimore Orioles and Los Angeles Dodgers, playing in 162 games with 145 starts at shortstop.
Machado’s personal preference was to sign with the New York Yankees and met with the team in December, but there have been no negotiations between the sides in recent months.
