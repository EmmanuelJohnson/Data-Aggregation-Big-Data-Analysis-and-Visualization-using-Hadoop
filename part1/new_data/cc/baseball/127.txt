NEW YORK (AP) â€” New York Mets 1969 World Series champion Ed Kranepool and Yankees manager Aaron Boone will be honored at next month's Thurman Munson awards dinner.
They will be joined Feb. 5 by Yankees Didi Gregorius and Miguel Andujar, along with Giants two-time Super Bowl champion Zak DeOssie.
The Munson awards are presented annually for success on and off the field. The 74-year-old Kranepool, who is awaiting a kidney donor, will receive his award from teammate Ron Swoboda.
Munson, the late Yankees captain and catcher, died in a private plane crash in 1979. The event benefits AHRC New York City Foundation, which assists children and adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
