A Texas State University finance major hadn’t heard of Trevor Bauer when she chided the Cleveland Indians pitcher on Twitter over the weekend. 
Days later, Nikki Giles told USA TODAY Sports she’s been reduced to tears by the barrage of responses from Bauer and some of his 135,000 followers. Giles said she’s reported the harassment to the Indians via the team’s official Facebook page and flagged three of Bauer’s tweets in a complaint to Twitter. 
“It has definitely ruined my last three days,” Giles told USA TODAY Sports. “I have cried daily and called my family crying because the first 12-24 hours or so I was getting a lot of hate.”
The interaction began Saturday night after Bauer responded to a tweet from Giles’ favorite player, Houston’s Alex Bregman: “Thanks for admitting I’m better than you 😘”
Giles jokingly tweeted a response to Bauer writing, “My new least favorite person in all sports.”
Bauer appeared to play along  – writing “Welcome to the fan club 😘” – before things escalated. Giles and Bauer traded barbs, including Giles mentioning that Bauer doesn’t have a World Series ring. 
Bauer then ramped things up.
"He went almost a year back into my Twitter to find a tweet about me drinking two months before my 21st birthday and exposed it to his followers," Giles said. 
Bauer also alleged Giles, a senior in college, was the instigator.  
“He blamed me for ‘continuously tweeting him,’ ” Giles said. (That) makes zero sense because he had tagged me in over 40 tweets, which is over 10x as many tweets I mentioned him in.”
Giles blocked Bauer, for a while. 
"I eventually unblocked him when someone brought to my attention that he had tagged me in 30 more tweets in responses," Giles said. "And when I said I felt harassed, he continued to tweet things like this claiming that I was responding to him because 'I like him.' ”
Bauer responded to another Twitter user who said Giles "likes" him by writing, "She conducts herself as someone who does but doesn’t know how to express it."
"The most annoying part of it is that he has tweeted multiple times things along those lines," Giles said.
By Tuesday, Bauer had mentioned Giles in 80 different tweets. Giles mentioned Bauer 20 times in tweets, some reacting to a Deadspin story about the exchange on Monday. 
Bauer posted a tweet  Monday in which he wrote Giles was “obsessed” with him and included a video of Bauer blocking Giles. 
A spokesperson for the Indians declined to comment when reached by USA TODAY Sports on Tuesday. 
“We won’t comment on this,” Joel Wolfe, Bauer’s agent, told USA TODAY Sports when reached for comment. 
Giles said she has received no responses from the Indians or Twitter.
Giles said while Bauer’s posts often were troubling, it was some of his followers who were more concerning. 
Bauer has caused stirs before on social media.
He alleged in May that Astros pitchers were getting an edge because they were illegally using pine tar. Last March, he wrote that MLB officials had tried to censor his political opinions.
