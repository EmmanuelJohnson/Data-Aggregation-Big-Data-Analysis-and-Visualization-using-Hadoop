.A lukewarm pursuit of Manny Machado might have just gone cold for the New York Yankees
On Friday, the Yankees and infielder D.J. LeMahieu agreed on a two-year, $24 million contract, first reported by the YES Network’s Jack Curry.
And that surprising deal for a versatile infielder and former NL batting champ further jams Machado’s route to the Bronx.
Last week, the Yankees signed veteran Troy Tulowitzki, with the idea that he’d open the season at shortstop in place of Didi Gregorius (Tommy John surgery), who is not expected to return until June at the earliest.
That kept Gleyber Torres at second base and Miguel Andujar at third, but LeMahieu's addition seems to indicate that Torres will see time at short as well. LeMahieu has also played 41 games at third base in his eight-year career.
A two-time All-Star and three-time Gold Glove winner at second base with the Rockies, LeMahieu, 30, batted .276 last season with 15 home runs and 62 RBI in 128 games.
Over the past four seasons in Colorado, LeMahieu has averaged a .309/.369/.429 slash line. He won the batting title in 2016 with a .348 average. 
Machado's former Orioles teammate Zach Britton had his deal with the Yankees made official Friday and he spoke about his relationship with the star free agent.
“We keep in contact," Britton said. “He’s a good teammate and an even better player…a special talent.’’
Britton wouldn’t reveal the content of his recent conversations with Machado, but, “I’m hoping that decision gets made and he’s a New York Yankee,'' the lefty said, adding that whatever decision Machado made would be the right one.
The LeMahieu agreement had not been made official by the Yankees as of Friday afternoon.
