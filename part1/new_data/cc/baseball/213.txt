Major League Baseball's "disabled list" will be renamed the "injured list," a person with direct knowledge of the proposal confirmed to USA TODAY Sports.
The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because the league had not yet made an announcement. ESPN first reported the plan.
The new designation intends to reflect that injured players do not in fact, have a disability.
Deputy Commissioner Dan Halem said Thursday the change is being made at the suggestion of advocacy groups.
"In recent years, the commissioner has received several inquiries regarding the name of the 'Disabled List,'" Pfeifer wrote in a memo. "The principal concern is that using the term 'disabled' for players who are injured supports the misconception that people with disabilities are injured and therefore are not able to participate or compete in sports.
"As a result, Major League Baseball has agreed to change the name 'Disabled List' to be the 'Injured List' at both the major and minor league levels. All standards and requirements for placement, reinstatement, etc., shall remain unchanged. This change, which is only a rebranding of the name itself, is effective immediately."
The name change won't impact the rules for injured players and baseball will maintain its current 10 and 60-day variations.
MLB instituted the 10-day disabled list to replace the15-day variant for the 2017 season, but there have been calls for the league to switch back as teams have been accused of using the shorter stay to manipulate rosters. Among the proposals bartered about between MLB and the players' association this winter includes a concept that would keep the injured list at 10 days for position players, but return to a 15-day minimum for pitchers.
