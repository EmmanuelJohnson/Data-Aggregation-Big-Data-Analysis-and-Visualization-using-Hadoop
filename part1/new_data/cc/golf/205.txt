From the feel-good department, LPGA star Brittany Lincicome and her long-drive husband Dewald Gouws used exploding an golf ball for their gender reveal Monday evening.
And while the LPGA's twitter poll had 52 percent of voters guessing it would be a boy, the smashing couple will in fact welcome a baby girl in 2019.
Lincicome, 33, makes her return to competition on the LPGA at next week's Bank of Hope Founders Cup March 21-24 in Phoenix. The two-time major champion played in the season-opening Diamond Resorts Tournament of Champions but skipped the next four overseas events.
During a recent press conference for the ANA Inspiration Lincicome, a two-time winner of the year's first major, said she feels "awesome."
"Literally I feel bad telling people this, said Lincicome. "Like if I wouldn't have taken a pregnancy test, I would have no clue I'm pregnant. I've had no sickness. I've had no cramping, no nothing. We went for our 12-week appointment, did the blood work and the baby looks great. I have an appointment next week. It doesn't feel real yet."
Lincicome is due on Sept. 1 and has made phone calls to new moms Gerina Piller and Stacy Lewis for advice.
"I'll play as long as I possibly can," said Lincicome, "but the summer months are going to be tough because they are going to be really hot. It's a lot of walking. So we're just going to play it week by week and just kind of see what happens, and we're just going to roll with it. But it's going to be a very interesting and obviously very fun year."
