Tony Romo, former Dallas Cowboys quarterback and current star of the CBS Sports NFL booth, showed off his golf game on Friday at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am.
On the 15th hole, Romo somehow ended up on a patio for spectators.
No matter. he then hit a wedge off the carpet, stopped his ball about a foot away from the cup and then made birdie.
He continued his magic on the back nine here.
A Super Bowl on Sunday and this on Friday.
Not a bad week.
