Patrick Reed is the rare American golfer to play a true international schedule, and now he’s even more free to do so.
The European Tour announced Friday that Reed had been awarded Honorary Life Membership to the circuit in recognition of his 2018 Masters win.
This makes it 55 players now who have received this honor, and the second time in three months with Francesco Molinari grabbing it in December.
But it is still a rare award considering Reed’s nationality. Reed, 28, becomes just the fourth American to receive the honor. The other three? Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer and Tom Watson.
That’s pretty heady company right there.
“Words can’t really describe how proud I am right now,” Reed said in a European Tour release. “It’s always been a dream of mine to be a worldwide player and play on both Tours. Now, to be able to fulfill that on the European Tour, and to travel the world and grow the game means so much to me.”
Reed may have become known as “Captain America” for his strong Ryder Cup performances as a member of the U.S. team, but he has played double digit events on the European Tour in three seasons (2015, ’17 and ’18). He finished the 2018 campaign second in the Race to Dubai thanks to his Masters win and five other top-10 showings.
MORE FROM GOLFWEEK:
He has two European Tour wins overall with his 2018 Masters triumph and his victory at the 2014 WGC-Cadillac Championship. Those both count as PGA Tour wins as well.
So Reed is still yet to own a solely European Tour title and his main circuit remains the PGA Tour (where he’s played 25 or more events in each of the last six seasons).
Regardless, he has made his mark on the European Tour. And with this award, Reed will be able to continue to do so for a long time without a doubt.
