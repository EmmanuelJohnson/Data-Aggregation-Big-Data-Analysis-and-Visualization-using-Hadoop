BARWON HEADS, Australia (AP) â€” Kim Kaufman moved to the top of the leaderboard at the LPGA's Vic Open after a 7-under 66 gave her a two-stroke lead after two rounds.
The American had a 36-hole total of 13-under on Friday, two better than Japan's Haru Nomura. Australian Su Oh was another stroke behind in third.
Kaufman was diagnosed with glandular fever in 2018, but is back to full fitness for the 2019 season.
"The last time I was in the final group on a Sunday was at the 2017 Tour Championship," she said. "It's just nice to be back. It was a long year last year, but you just have to keep working hard and believing in yourself."
Overnight leader Felicity Johnson of England was seven strokes behind after a 2-over 74.
In the men's event being played concurrently with the women's tournament, first-round leader Nick Flanagan shot a 4-under 68 and was tied for the second-round lead with fellow Australian Jason Scrivener.
The men and women are teeing off in alternate groups over two courses at the 13th Beach Golf Links.
The Beach course is being played as a par-72 for both men and women; the Creek is par-72 for men and 73 for women. Both courses will be used for the first two rounds of the tournament.
The Women's Australian Open, also sanctioned by the LPGA, will be played next week at The Grange in Adelaide. The men's European Tour is co-sanctioning the Perth International in Western Australia.
