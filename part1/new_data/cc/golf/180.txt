Tony Romo will follow his Pebble Beach Pro-Am appearance by playing in his hometown AT&T Byron Nelson.
Tournament organizers announced Tuesday that Romo has accepted a sponsor's exemption to play in the May 9-12 tournament in Dallas. Romo, who will play as an amateur, is a member of Trinity Forest Golf Club, the host course of the Byron Nelson.
Earlier this month, Romo withdrew from the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am ahead of Saturday's third round. He left to attend the funeral of Wade Wilson, his former quarterbacks coach with the Dallas Cowboys.
At Pebble, Romo and partner Jim Furyk shot 70-65 and were near the bottom of the pack at 8-under when Romo withdrew.
