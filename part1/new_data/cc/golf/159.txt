PERTH, Australia (AP) â€” Miguel Tabuena birdied nine of his first 10 holes Thursday on his way to a 7-under-par 65 and a share of the first-round lead at the World Super 6 European Tour event at Lake Karrinyup.
Tabuena was tied with Kristoffer Reitan, who had eight birdies and a bogey. They had a two-stroke lead over Benjamin Campbell and Richard McEvoy.
Tabuena, who started his day on the back nine, said his game was affected once the TV cameras started focusing on him. He had two bogeys on his final eight holes.
"I started to force shots that I wasn't comfy with," Tabuena said. "I started to go at pins when I shouldn't have, and the bogey on the par-3 fifth cost me."
Tournament favorite Thomas Pieters, who was affected by a flu-like illness upon his arrival, finished with a 70. Geoff Ogilvy, the 2006 U.S. Open winner, had five bogeys and shot a 76.
The first three rounds of the tournament are stroke play. The top 24 players will qualify for the final-round match play, which consists of a series of elimination six-hole shootouts. If a shootout is tied at the end of six holes, a 90-meter shootout hole will decide the winner, including in the championship match.
