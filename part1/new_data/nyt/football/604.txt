Last year, the U.S. economy seemed solid. Skittishness in the stock and bond markets appeared at odds with signs of stability on the ground. But this week’s flow of distressing news, showing ever more evidence of slowing growth, suggests that the markets had cause for concern:
• Apple reduced its revenue expectations for the first time in 16 years, citing weak iPhone sales in China.
• Delta Air Lines said its fare revenue, although growing, would fall short of the company’s earlier forecast.
• The American manufacturing sector slowed sharply last month, according to a closely watched index released yesterday.
And things could get worse, especially amid trade tensions with China, as companies line up to report fourth-quarter results in the next few weeks. Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, told CNN on yesterday:
“There are a heck of a lot of U.S. companies that have a lot of sales in China that are basically going to be watching their earnings be downgraded next year until we get a deal with China.”
More on markets: Forty-six percent of American companies issuing estimates for the fourth-quarter have revised their outlook lower, the most since President Trump’s inauguration. Traders are placing bets on whether the Fed will be forced to change course by a slowing economy and swooning stock market. Investors have piled into money market funds as a shelter from market turmoil. China will keep trying to attract bond investors, and a fresh campaign to promote its currency is expected. If all this news makes you want to flee, that’s understandable. It’s also a bad idea.

The Labor Department will release its official hiring and unemployment figures for December at 8:30 a.m.
What to expect: Economists anticipate a gain of about 180,000 jobs, a rise from 155,000 reported in November. Average hourly earnings are expected to tick up 0.3 percent in December from November and 3 percent from a year earlier. The unemployment rate is forecast to fall to 3.6 percent from 3.7 percent.
What that means for the economy: Economists believe that fears of an imminent recession are overblown. The unemployment rate is near a 50-year low. Job openings have hit record highs, and a growing number of workers are quitting, a sign of confidence in the hiring outlook.
The Fed’s outlook: An indication of the Fed’s views on rates could come this morning at 10:30, when the central bank chairman, Jerome H. Powell, is scheduled to answer questions at a panel discussion in Atlanta with his two immediate predecessors, Janet Yellen and Ben S. Bernanke.
The world economy has relied for years on the shopping stamina of Chinese consumers. But that spending engine seems to be sputtering.
Apple’s surprise announcement this week was just one indicator that Chinese shoppers are pulling back. Amid a tense trade war with the United States, a shaky job market and efforts by Beijing to rein in what one analyst called a decade-long “debt-fueled binge,” Chinese consumers are feeling less than confident. Property sales are down, as are auto and retail sales.
The NYT’s Alexandra Stevenson, Li Yuan and Raymond Zhong write:
“A significant pullback could have a big impact on a world looking for engines of growth, on companies that counted on China’s continuing expansion and on global investors who have long viewed Chinese consumers as a steady source of profits.”
The Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, met today with the three largest commercial banks in the country and pushed for policies to help bolster the economy, including lower taxes and fees and more financing for small and private companies. Today, China’s central bank said that, by Jan. 25, it will scale back the amount of cash it requires lenders to hold in reserve by one percentage point.
The tech giant’s problems are not limited to nervous Chinese consumers, according to the WSJ. Competitors in China, such as Huawei, are moving in on Apple’s smartphone market share. In India, a growth market, Apple is a minor player. Customers in the U.S. are keeping their phones longer.
Tom Warren at The Verge had this take:
“People are upgrading less, carrier subsidies aren’t enough, and $1,000 phones are making consumers pause and consider. Mix that in with fears of a recession, and 2019 could be challenging for Apple and many others.”
The company may pull iPhones from its German stores after Qualcomm took steps yesterday to enforce a court order last month banning the sale of certain versions of the device. The order stems from a ruling that Apple infringed on the chip-maker’s patents involving power-saving technology.
Apple’s woes were keenly felt yesterday by its third-largest shareholder, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. Tumbling prices for Apple and airline stocks caused more than $4 billion in value to evaporate from Mr. Buffett’s stakes in the companies, according to the FT.
The companies, both top sellers of cancer drugs with Bristol-Myers’s Opdivo and Celgene’s Revlimid, agreed to a cash-and-stock deal valued at roughly $74 billion. It was one of the largest takeovers in the industry’s history.
• The deal values Celgene shares at $102.43 apiece, or a nearly 54 percent premium on the stock’s closing price on Wednesday.
• The combined entity will produce nine drugs with annual sales of more than $1 billion each.
• The WSJ points out some concerns with the acquisition: Bristol-Myers could take on more than $50 billion in debt. It will have to help Celgene, whose stock slumped nearly 40 percent last year, diversify its pipeline beyond Revlimid.
A number of fund managers say that traders who use quantitative strategies to exploit market signals have made markets more chaotic and unpredictable. But Clifford Asness, the founder of AQR, one of the world’s biggest hedge fund groups, told the FT that investors who blame the recent market turmoil on quant strategies are “insane.”
AQR suffered some of the worst losses in its 20-year history in 2018, and Mr. Asness said that critics were only trying to find excuses for their own poor performance. He pointed out that markets had always suffered bouts of turbulence even before quant strategies were introduced, and said there was little hard evidence that they were feeding volatility.
