If the average cultural experience demands the suspension of disbelief, if we oughtn’t think too much about this movie we’re watching, this novel we’re reading, this magic trick being performed right before our eyes, if being entertained means setting aside skepticism, logic and possibly a sense of morality, then what a magic trick we had in Michael Jackson.
He lived in defiance of physics and race and gender, and we just kind of lived with that. We ate it up. Just the odyssey of his nose from bulb to nub seemed somehow like a people’s journey. For so long, so much about Michael Jackson won our awe, our pity, our bewilderment, our identification, our belief that he was a metaphor, an allegory, a beacon, a caveat — for, of, about America. You need to do a lot of looking at him to feel this way. You also need to do a lot of looking the other way.
But, eventually, all the suspension reaches a logical end. You run out of hooks to hang things on. There’s a moment in “Leaving Neverland,” Dan Reed’s documentary about Jackson’s alleged pedophilia, where I simply ran out of hooks. The movie devotes itself to two men, Wade Robson and James Safechuck, who claim, in separate accounts, that Jackson sexually abused them for years, from boyhood into adolescence.
[Michael Jackson’s history of sexual abuse accusations.]
And of all the allegations, the moment that really got me is the ring.
Now, this is 90 minutes into a four-hour movie, which HBO is showing in two parts starting Sunday, and I’ve learned how Jackson has ingratiated himself into two families, starting around 1987 or ’88, after the release of his album “Bad,” during his world tour. I’ve heard a recording of a mock interview Jackson does with Safechuck, a solidly middle-class Southern California boy, in which Jackson says the best part of a trip to Hawaii that he arranged for the boy and his mom was “being with James Safechuck.”
I’ve stared at a lingering shot of a photograph of Jackson, who would have been around 30 and Safechuck who was about 9 or 10, and Jackson is beaming in sunglasses and a military jacket, flashing a peace sign, and James, in a too-big baseball cap, is turning to the camera, looking alarmingly ruminative for someone whose life should be rumination-free. By the time you get to the ring, I’ve already heard how Jackson lured Safechuck into sex, by masturbation (James, again, is about 10), and how the closer he got to James on tour, the farther the parents’ hotel room would get from their son’s.
The way Safechuck remembers it, there was so much sex, and he says Jackson told him that if anybody found out about it, their lives would be over. I’ve heard about Michael buying the Neverland complex in Santa Barbara County, Calif., (mansion, amusement park, zoo!) and the elaborate system of doors and bells to alert Jackson of any encroachment on the lair in which some of the abuse supposedly occurred. I’ve seen Wade Robson, a doll-faced Michael Jackson impersonator from Brisbane, Australia, say he was 7 when Michael began abusing him, describing a grim scenario in which he was naked on all fours at the edge of the bed, poised — trapped — between his idol, who was masturbating to him, and a cutout of Peter Pan.
I’ve heard all of this — and a distressing deal more — by the time the documentary gets to the part where Jackson allegedly takes Safechuck shopping for a ring. But there’s something about the way the filmmakers reserve this scene for the back end of Part 1 that ices your bones, something about the way an adult Safechuck doesn’t seem to want to go back there. But here he is, talking in a TV documentary about the vows he says that he and Jackson exchanged. Here he is, forlorn, holding the ring that he’s kept, all this time, in a handsome box.
The story of the ring and the vows feels as graphic as the memories of masturbation and French kissing and nipple tweaking. If you happen to be the sort of person who’d try to balance, say, the multiple counts of child molestation Jackson was charged with in 2003 and acquitted of later with extenuating details from Jackson’s biography (Wasn’t he abused and too famous too soon and prematurely sexualized? He never had a childhood! He’s still a child!), if you partook in the steady diet of fluffy news stories about Jackson and some little boy (often identified as “Jackson’s friend”) and thought mostly that they were cute or banal and that Jackson just related to kids as kids — like, platonically — if you thought that he couldn’t know there was a real difference between adult passion and child’s play, then perhaps you’ll find Safechuck’s memory of the ring particularly shattering. I did. It’s so private and wrong, not just to us but clearly to Jackson, who makes up a story at the jewelry store that the ring is for a woman, even though Safechuck is there by his side.
He knew.
I’m staring at the coat rack looking for somewhere to suspend more disbelief, and there’s no more room. I have to hold this.
transcript
Hosted by Michael Barbaro, produced by Annie Brown, Theo Balcomb and Andy Mills, and edited by Lisa Tobin
The pop star’s legacy has been shadowed by sexual abuse accusations for decades. Wesley Morris grapples with why the world has, for so long, looked the other way.
michael barbaro
From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: For decades, despite a swirl of allegations around him, Michael Jackson earned the world’s admiration, bewilderment and pity. Times culture critic Wesley Morris on the moment that ended for him. It’s Friday, March 8. Wesley, this is the second time in two weeks that we had you on to talk about culture.
wesley morris
I know. Aren’t you sick of me already?
michael barbaro
Not at all.
wesley morris
O.K.
michael barbaro
What do we need to talk about this week?
wesley morris
It’s probably “Leaving Neverland,” this Michael Jackson documentary.
archived recording
Not a trailer or even a single clip of this new documentary has been released ahead of its debut today, but that has not slowed the buzz behind it.
wesley morris
I became aware of this movie as it was making its way towards Sundance in January.
archived recording (speaker 1)
It’s probably right now the most talked about film at Sundance.
archived recording (speaker 2)
One of the hottest tickets at Sundance is also one of the most controversial.
wesley morris
I also knew on the other hand that there were these camps of people who were going to try to stop the movie from being screened, because, well, because it’s about Michael Jackson. And it’s about some terrible things that Michael Jackson is being accused of having done.

This morning, police in Utah preparing for possible protests at the Sundance Film Festival.
wesley morris
And there is a strong camp of Michael Jackson fans and supporters that do not want lies, in their eyes, spread about him.

The Jackson estate has denounced the documentary as defamatory.
wesley morris
And before the movie even got there, before anyone had even seen it, there was this sense that it was going to be controversial, because it was going to force us to reassess our relationship with Michael Jackson.
michael barbaro
And what about you? How are you approaching the idea of this movie?
wesley morris
With dread. I mean, I knew I was going to watch it. But I also knew that I was bringing with me some dread. I loved Michael Jackson as a kid. And it wasn’t just so much that I loved the music, although there was that. I loved looking at Michael Jackson. I loved how fascinating his physical appearance was. And I can’t go back to being a 7-, 8-, 9-, 10-year-old —
michael barbaro
Can you try just for a minute?
wesley morris
I mean, I can go back to telling you stories about that.
michael barbaro
Place me a little bit in the life of the young Wesley Morris.
wesley morris
Well, I grew up poor in Philadelphia. And we didn’t have a lot of money, but we had a lot of money for Michael Jackson. We bought — we bought “Thriller.” I think we had two copies of “Thriller,” because one got warped. And I was lucky enough to —
michael barbaro
That’s not O.K.
wesley morris
That? Well, no. I mean, I can remember sitting — the album would fold out. And it’s Michael Jackson lying down in what can only be called a Sears photo studio portrait pose. He’s wearing a white suit with a black shirt. And he’s got a tiger on his knee. A tiger cub. And his hair’s really curly, and his nose is straighter than any black person’s nose I had ever seen. He’s got these big, bright eyes. I just was so drawn to how perfect-looking this person was.
michael barbaro
How present was this attachment to Michael Jackson at this tender age?
wesley morris
Well, I assume that everybody felt this way about Michael Jackson. I assume that everybody had bought a copy of “Thriller.” And, you know, I’d go to people’s houses and be like, wait, where’s “Thriller“? I mean, nobody wants this Kenny Rogers record. Where’s “Thriller“? My dad took me somewhere and before we got to the house once, he’s like, Wesley, no. You are not going near the albums this time. And you’re not asking about Michael Jackson. And I just remember thinking that he was the most important person in the world. So there is looking at Michael Jackson, and then there is experiencing Michael Jackson. And that experience I had with the album cover — the album would have been out for about a year.

[CHEERING]
wesley morris
It’s 1983. And I’m watching this “Motown 25” special, which is a gathering of all of Motown’s greatest artists. And at some point —

[MUSIC]
wesley morris
The Jacksons come out, and they’re all together. All the grown brothers — they’re performing. They do their most famous songs. Motown is basically paying tribute to itself.

wesley morris
And then at some point, they thank everybody. They leave the stage. And Michael Jackson stays behind.
archived recording (michael jackson)
Oh, you’re beautiful. Those were magic moments. All my brothers, including Jermaine.
wesley morris
He tells the audience —
archived recording (michael jackson)
I like those songs a lot.
wesley morris
I like the old hits, but —
archived recording (michael jackson)
But especially, I like the new songs. [MUSIC]
wesley morris
Fasten your seat belts, basically — here comes the next 50 years. It was just a new sound. It pulled in rock. It pulled in African rhythms. And he is leaping onto his toes. He is swinging his leg up in kind of what I can only call, like, a chicken flap.
archived recording
[MUSIC]
wesley morris
And at some point, after you see all this other dancing that you’ve never really seen done in quite this way before, he starts gliding backwards. And now we know that this backward glide is called the moonwalk. I was in my mother’s bedroom watching this, and I could remember just sitting there in just absolute awe. You could feel it as you watched it. This man was changing everything. In terms of historical American events, you know, on the one hand, you have the moon landing. And then you have the moonwalk. And I would argue there’s probably no other artist who is as important to where popular music currently is than Michael Jackson.

[MUSIC]
wesley morris
You can hear him actually sampled in other people’s music. You can hear other artists who’ve built entire careers — artists you probably wouldn’t even have if there was no Michael Jackson.

[MUSIC]
wesley morris
So I’m thinking about all of this as I am dragging myself through the winter weather to go watch this movie.
michael barbaro
That’s a lot to carry with you into a screening, a movie theater — your childhood, all of American culture. That’s not nothing.
wesley morris
No, it’s not nothing. But it’s weird, though, because I carry it with me all the time. The reason that it was so heavy — and I think the reason that a lot of people are experiencing this heaviness and this dread about this movie — is like, I’m carrying around baggage I didn’t even know I had. And then all of a sudden, it feels like baggage. You know, it feels like this thing you’ve been lugging around with you all these years, this love of Michael Jackson. And now, like, this rocket ship to bliss? That is not an easy thing to be willing to let go of.
michael barbaro
Well, talk me through this. You have to sit down and watch this movie.
wesley morris
Yeah.
michael barbaro
Where did you watch it?
wesley morris
The first time I watched it, I watched it in an office. It was basically a conference room at HBO. They showed me the movie. I was alone in a nice little corner conference room with a TV, and you know, it was me and my notepad. And all my baggage. And it was funny, because I watched it by myself, and I realized once I was there and the door was closed and this thing was starting that I didn’t want to be there anymore. I just, I looked around, and I’m like, I don’t want to do this. I don’t want to do it! But, you know, I’m a professional. What does it look like if I open the door and ask if we can stop? Can we stop? But the ride had already left the bay. So I stayed. And I watched the whole thing, all four hours.
michael barbaro
And what’s the first thing that you noticed about the film?
wesley morris
Oh, my god, it’s so quiet. It’s really quiet.
archived recording
I think when I was with him, he was happy. He was at the peak of his creativity, and he was at the peak of his success.
wesley morris
So a lot of string music. But what you really are aware of is just that you’re going to hear two people and the people in their lives talk about their relationship to Michael Jackson.
archived recording
He was already larger than life. And then he likes you.
michael barbaro
And who are these two people?
wesley morris
One of them is Wade Robson.
archived recording
Wade won a dancing competition this week on Thursday Night in — Wade Robson met Michael Jackson as a Michael Jackson impersonator. I started to like Michael, and I started copying the moves, and that’s how I started dancing.
wesley morris
I would say the best one I have ever seen in my life. I’m talking about, like, a six-year-old kid.
michael barbaro
Wow.
archived recording
I want to be a star and keep everybody happy while I’m doing it.
wesley morris
He was good early. And the other is James Safechuck —
archived recording
Michael?
wesley morris
— who began as a child actor. He was cast in a Michael Jackson commercial.
archived recording
Mr. Jackson?
wesley morris
And that’s how they met.
archived recording
Looking for me?
wesley morris
I was prepared for this movie to begin with the allegations, right? I was prepared for them to just be like, here’s what Michael Jackson did. But that’s not really how it goes.
archived recording
We went into the closet. We’re looking at his stuff. And he told me I can pick out a jacket. I could have that. It would be mine. I picked the “Thriller” jacket.
wesley morris
How it goes is each person who speaks speaks as though they’re in the present moment that they’re speaking about.
archived recording (speaker 1)
And I took it home. I wore it to the grocery store.
archived recording (speaker 2)
It felt great. Out of all the kids in the world, he chose me to be his friend. And he’s holding my hand.
wesley morris
I was really struck by how even though you know what’s coming — and this is sort of a comfort in a way for, I don’t know, I would imagine for lots of people who were dreading watching this movie — they’re talking about, as children, how much they loved Michael Jackson.
archived recording
The days were filled with playing tag, watching movies. He taught me how to do the moonwalk.
wesley morris
They got to do the thing that I sat on my living room floor —
michael barbaro
Dreaming about.
wesley morris
Dreaming about.
archived recording
I came on at the end of the song “Bad.” I had a “Bad” outfit on that was just like his.
wesley morris
It seemed as a kid so fun, being one of the kids in Michael Jackson’s orbit.
archived recording
And so I would dance. We side-moonwalked and did a few moves together.
wesley morris
I got to relive that for a little tiny bit. And then they start talking about the turn the relationship takes into a sexual relationship.
archived recording
I was seven, seven years old, when this began.
michael barbaro
And what do they describe? And I recognize that these are really traumatic memories that they’re talking about.
wesley morris
Well, I mean, all kinds of things that are graphic in nature — masturbation, oral sex, lots of kissing — and you also learn how Michael Jackson was kind of fostering these relationships and keeping the boys close to him.
archived recording (speaker 1)
You know, he started talking about how much he loves me. What this is is us, how we show our love for each other. That the other people are ignorant, and they’re stupid, they’d never understand. If they ever found out what we were doing, about this sexual stuff, that he and I would be pulled apart, and that we’d never be able to see each other again. And that he and I would go to jail for the rest of our lives.
archived recording (speaker 2)
You start to think that your parents are bad and that Michael is good.
michael barbaro
So you’re seeing the mechanisms by which he is creating proximity and loyalty to these boys.
wesley morris
There’s a kind of choreography at work here. You also learn that Michael told them not to go to school, that he would be the person who would teach the kids things. The psychological gamesmanship that he deployed in these relationships is also shocking.
archived recording (james safechuck)
You know, I liked jewelry, and I liked it as a kid, and I think that —
wesley morris
And eventually, you get to this point where James Safechuck is telling this story about Michael Jackson taking him shopping for rings. And —
michael barbaro
Rings?
wesley morris
Yeah, like wedding rings. Like, we’re going to get married rings.
archived recording (james safechuck)
And the ring is nice. It has a row of diamonds with a gold band.
wesley morris
You know, there’s always a moment whenever I’m watching or listening or reading anything — you’re waiting for this moment for something in you to change. And for me, it was the story about these rings.
archived recording (james safechuck)
We would go buy them at jewelry stores.
wesley morris
Basically, Michael Jackson and James Safechuck go to a jewelry store. The assumption is that Michael’s going to buy James a ring, and Michael’s going to have his own ring. And they’re going to exchange rings and vows.
michael barbaro
Adult and child.
wesley morris
Yes. Adult and child. And at some point during this purchase, the salesperson, I don’t know, probably seems a little bit skeptical, and Michael Jackson says that the purchase is, oh, it’s for a woman. It’s for a woman.
archived recording (james safechuck)
And we would pretend like they were for somebody else and — for a female. But we’d pretend like my small hand fit whatever female we were buying it for. Yeah.
wesley morris
You know in this moment that Michael Jackson knows the difference between right and wrong, because he lies.
archived recording (james safechuck)
My hands are shaking just holding them.
wesley morris
Now, James, by the way, in this moment in the movie, is holding the ring. He’s got an adult hand now, because he’s a grown man. And the ring won’t fit over his finger, because it’s a child’s ring.
archived recording (james safechuck)
We had this mock wedding ceremony. We did this in his bedroom. And we filled out some vows. It’s like we’re bonded forever. It felt good.
wesley morris
I don’t know, man. I really, really, really was not prepared for that.
michael barbaro
So in that moment, your vision of Michael Jackson is what? Is shattered? Is altered? Ruined?
wesley morris
It’s definitely changed. And it’s definitely complicated. I remember writing down in my notebook, this is it. This is — this is — I’m out. I’m out.
michael barbaro
Out of what?
wesley morris
I’m out of the Michael Jackson house. And it’s not — it’s more complicated than that. But that is definitely the moment that makes it hard to make excuses, right? I think for me, the plausible deniability way of living with Michael Jackson gets really, really tough.
michael barbaro
I wonder why this moment shattered you, because these allegations against Michael Jackson have been floating around now for decades.
wesley morris
Oh, man. I think because for a long time, Michael Jackson controlled this story. He had all the power.
archived recording (michael jackson)
The press has made up so much god-awful, horrifying stories that are completely appalling. Completely appalling.
wesley morris
So, with the first set of allegations in 1993, he winds up talking to Oprah Winfrey in a hugely watched, desperately anticipated television interview. And I mean, she does everything she can do.
archived recording (oprah winfrey)
Is your skin lighter because you don’t like being black? Did he ever beat you? Do you go out? Do you date?
wesley morris
She asks all the questions.
archived recording (oprah winfrey)
Are you pleased now with the way you look?
archived recording (michael jackson)
I’m never pleased with anything. I’m a perfectionist. It’s part of who I am.
wesley morris
And he’s got some kind of answer for it. And I think that we really, really wanted to believe him.
michael barbaro
And what’s the story he tells?
wesley morris
Well, the story he tells is like, I like kids. I was lonely. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with my relationship with children.
archived recording (michael jackson)
People wonder why I always have children around. Because I find the thing that I never had through them. You know, Disneyland, amusement parks, arcade games. I adore all that stuff, because when I was little, it was always work, work, work, from one concert to the next.
wesley morris
The story he told Oprah was the story we wanted and the thing that would let us keep going back and listening to “Dangerous,” which was the album that he had out at the time. It made it a lot easier to go back to regularly scheduled programming.
michael barbaro
He told a story that fit into our story of him, which is a lonely man who, at his core, is still a boy.
wesley morris
Yeah, that’s the story of Michael Jackson.
archived recording (michael jackson)
There were times when I had great times with my brothers — pillow fights and things. But I was always — I used to always cry from loneliness.
archived recording (oprah winfrey)
You did?
archived recording (michael jackson)
Yes.
archived recording (oprah winfrey)
Beginning at what age?
archived recording (michael jackson)
Oh, very little. Eight, nine.
wesley morris
It was — this is clearly a person who is suffering and has been damaged in some way.
archived recording (oprah winfrey)
What do you want the world to know about you most? I asked Liz that of you. What do you want them to know?
archived recording (michael jackson)
To be loved. I just simply want to be loved, wherever I go. All over the world, because I love people of all races, from my heart, with true affection.
wesley morris
I think that the difference between what happens in that initial conversation with Oprah Winfrey and what’s happening in this movie is that it’s a wresting of control of the narrative, right? It is these two men telling you what happened to them. And you take their stories, and you put them alongside Michael Jackson’s, and you sit with it. And I’d been waiting for somebody to come along and tell me a story that I could sit alongside Michael Jackson’s to confirm a suspicion that I had had all this time and didn’t want to acknowledge. That I was carrying around all this stuff all these years and not really knowing what to do with it.
michael barbaro
Wesley, will this film and the revelations that it contains, will this change the legacy of Michael Jackson?
wesley morris
Yes. I think the people who want to hear the stories these men are telling, I think the people who watch this movie, I think the people who’ve ambiently suspected that something like what’s alleged in this movie happened — those people will think about Michael Jackson in a different way. But Michael Jackson’s legacy is bigger than Michael Jackson, right? Michael Jackson is this human being who made stuff that is way bigger than he is. And that stuff is so much a part of the culture, like, on an atomic level. Right? It can’t be extracted. We can’t cancel Michael Jackson, because canceling Michael Jackson means canceling America in some way.
michael barbaro
Canceling some part of ourselves?
wesley morris
Like, a huge part of not just our love of music, but our sense of who we are as a people. I mean, the tragic thing about Michael Jackson is an American tragic thing. It is a story about race. It is a story about growing up poor and becoming extremely rich. It is a story about sexuality and gender and racial transformation in your physical body. I think that he means too much to delete or cancel. I mean, you make one thing go away, but you’re still dealing with all this other stuff. I just feel like he’s so much bigger than what he physically was. And I think the stories these men are telling need to go in the space that we culturally have been waiting to put a story like this in, based on everything we already knew about Michael Jackson.
michael barbaro
Wesley, it has felt to me like, with these other #MeToo stories, there’s been a very clear path to follow. Somebody should get fired. They do get fired. Somebody should go to jail. They do go to jail.
wesley morris
Oh, I see where you’re going.
michael barbaro
Somebody gets justice. But that can’t happen here. Michael Jackson is dead.
wesley morris
And he’s been tried and acquitted.
michael barbaro
And you can’t, as you just said, cancel his influence. So what could change?
wesley morris
Well, he can’t change, because he’s dead. The music can’t change, because it’s already been made and we’ve thoroughly absorbed it. I think the thing that has to change is us. We can change. But I also wonder whether or not the thing that we should be taking away from this entire problem with respect to Michael Jackson and Wade Robson and James Safechuck is this concept of justice. There’s no satisfying outcome for this. This is a tragedy. And we have to accept it as a tragedy. And I don’t think the way we accept a tragedy is by covering our ears when you hear a Michael Jackson song. We’re past that now. I think what we have to do is figure out a way to live with a thing that we’ve been living with this entire time. We have to be able to hold space that incorporates the bad stuff with the great stuff. It’s the only way this is going to work, because this is not going to stop happening. And it’s obviously not just famous people, it’s everybody. It’s coaches, it’s priests, it’s politicians. It doesn’t work to just make people go away and not deal with the root problem of this behavior. And I think with Michael Jackson — I think that the reason the “what do we do now?” is so dissatisfying is because there’s nothing to do but listen and move through the world aware that this person did this. And it can’t be undone. These guys don’t get their childhoods back. There’s no jail to put this man in. There’s no place to send him. And the work is on us. And I think part of the reason that people want either an easy answer or don’t want to know anything is because we don’t want to do the work. It’s hard work.
michael barbaro
The work of just living with it.
wesley morris
The hard work of trauma. And that’s what we’re talking about. That’s just called being a human being.
michael barbaro
Wesley, thank you very much once again for coming in.
wesley morris
Thanks for having me.
michael barbaro
In the latest episode of their podcast, “Still Processing,” Wesley and his co-host, Jenna Wortham, further explore their love for and discomfort with Michael Jackson.

“LEAVING NEVERLAND” is long but delicately, patiently done — and so quiet; you can practically hear yourself listening. It’s not a feat of investigative journalism so much as an act of bearing witness. Reed sits, individually, with Safechuck and his mother, Stephanie, and with Robson and his mother, Joy, and his siblings, Chantal and Shane. It doesn’t try to make cultural or political sense of the allegations. It’s not a masterpiece saga about fame, race, gender, sexuality and the legal system; it’s not “M.J.: Made in America.” (For a long view, there’s “On Michael Jackson,” Margo Jefferson’s pungent, essential critical X-ray from 2006.) “Leaving Neverland” is about one man’s possible contribution to the ruin of two families and the anguish that still disturbs them and, in some way, how that ruin and anguish should disturb us.
The movie presents Jackson almost entirely from the two families’ points of view, in photographs, answering machine messages and a montage of lovey-dovey faxes he sent to his “little one,” which is what Wade remembers Jackson calling him. He even remembers the lullaby Jackson built around the phrase. The movie recreates for us the haze Jackson cast over them. Its only moments of disputation arrive in the form of television, from, say, Jackson’s defense lawyers during the 2004-5 trial, and, in 1993, from Jackson himself, in a recorded statement against molestation charges brought by the father of Jordan Chandler. (It was nationally broadcast, as news.)
Reed appears to have encouraged everyone in the movie to try to be in the original moment as best they can. For James, Wade and the rest of the on-camera participants (Wade’s grandmother is here, too, as are, in Part 2, both men’s wives), they seem happy enough in the early telling, when everyone’s a little star-struck. So the movie has a real emotional arc — as well as an abundance of orchestral strings and too many handsome drone shots. The tears don’t come until well into hour four. James, though, appears to be reliving it all. He winces, cringes and grimaces; he does a lot of nervous neck scratching.
It’s here that I should offer the Jackson estate’s disclaimer. It vehemently denies what James and Wade allege, and is suing HBO for $100 million. The movie breaches a nondisparagement clause in a contract with Jackson from the early 1990s, according to the suit. Around 1993, James and Wade told the authorities that Jackson didn’t molest them; and Wade testified in court on Jackson’s behalf in 2005. Several years ago, both men filed lawsuits against the estate that were dismissed because of statutes of limitations. And their suits are now under appeal. Fatherhood and, presumably, therapy have encouraged both men to reverse their stories, acknowledge what they believe happened to them and tell their families that they lied about not being abused.
This is a strategy that puts a lot of faith in the accusers and obviates the possibility of counterargument. Much is asserted and nothing’s proven, and yet you do come to understand how a mix of showbiz and fandom brought so many boys into Jackson’s life. James starred in a 1986 Pepsi commercial with him. Wade’s uncannily sharp impersonation wins him some nights onstage during the “Bad” tour. Both Stephanie and Joy, the mothers, seem proud to have raised sons so appealing to the planet’s most worshiped person. He tells the Safechucks how lonely he is. And so, in an alarming throwaway detail, the family starts disguising Jackson in order to sneak him out of Hayvenhurst, his pre-Neverland estate, and into their normal, suburban house. It’s like he actually was E.T. At the Safechucks, Jackson could be a regular, what exactly, kid? We do see Polaroids of him sans make up, doing funny faces, looking guilelessly happy, so yeah, sure: a kid.

HAVING STEPHANIE AND JOY speak here as much as they do is a relief for any number of reasons. But let’s just focus on two. First, they’ve had some time to process all of this. They’re lucid. Jackson’s trial, conducted on behalf of a 13-year-old, Gavin Arvizo, featured testimony from Janet Arvizo, the boy’s mother, who spent five days on the stand and, by most accounts, was a terrible witness for her son. She claimed Jackson imprisoned her family, and yet she was allegedly free to leave Neverland to pamper herself? She snapped her fingers at the jury. The defense claimed she committed welfare fraud, for which she was later prosecuted. So we shifted the blame. What’s wrong with her?
The parents of any kid who passed through Neverland were more convenient to indict. How could you let your child sleep in an adult’s bed? It’s been 15 years, though. Someone should find Janet Arvizo and give her a do-over.
That brings me back to how crucial it feels to have Stephanie and Joy speaking in this documentary. (Neither man’s father is interviewed, although, in the case of James’s, we never find out exactly why.) You can’t hear a parent wrestle with this blame question enough, whether it’s being asked in relation to R. Kelly or Michael Jackson, your pastor or your priest: How could they let their child spend that much time with an adult stranger? There’s never a “right” or “good” answer. But faith is usually a factor. And faith entails a suspension of disbelief.
The mothers both mention an early limit they set. For Stephanie, it was refusing to let James sleep in Jackson’s room on that trip to Hawaii. And Joy recalls vehemently nixing Jackson’s request to abscond with Wade for a year. But Jackson ultimately wins, anyway. He gets his way, in part, because he could be as manipulative as he could be affectionate, but also because each woman feels, in her way, maternal toward him. He was, both women more or less say, a member of their families. Both families defended him, in the moment, against detractors and accusers. Both boys denied that they were molested — Wade at the trial and to the news media; James to his mother and to a grand jury. So their sons’ falling under his spell — that required some suspension of disbelief. The mothers had fallen, too.
We all had. It was so easy to fall.

NOBODY BOUGHT MORE Michael Jackson vinyl LPs than we did of “Thriller.” The euphoria for anything associated with that album was cross-racial and intergenerational. Upon visiting anybody’s house, I’d ask if they had a copy. If the answer was “no,” I’d turn into a 1980s sitcom kid and say something like, “What is your problem?” (I would have been 7, 8 or 9.) If the answer was “yes,” I’d ask to play it, and while it was on, I’d lie on the floor and take long drags on the album’s inside photo: Jackson, in a white suit, lying on his side, one leg bent, looking at us. On the knee of his bent leg is a tiger — a tiger cub. I stared with deep longing. He was so pretty, with his absurd curls and isosceles triangle of a nose and creamy brown face. I’m calling it a photo when, really, it was a centerfold. But what did I want from that picture? What did I want from Jackson? Friendship? A handshake? A souvenir? A hug?
Pictures and TV footage of Jackson and other boys were easy enough to come across — him and Emmanuel Lewis, him and Alfonso Ribeiro, him and Sean Lennon (none of whom have accused him of any abuse), him and E.T., him and the boy I now know is James Safechuck. There were so many of him and James. Google didn’t make these images simple to find. Magazines did. Teen magazines. I wanted a picture, too. I wanted the warmth and surprise and serious, only-us closeness in some of those images, although James never looks entirely happy in many of them. The seriousness I identified in a lot of the boys’ faces is what adult-me would now call stress.
At the time, I wanted my friends to see Michael Jackson whisking me out of airports and into limousines. I didn’t do an imitation of him or anything, and I never begged my mother to take me to see him. She didn’t have money for that. MTV and “Entertainment Tonight” and the stray issue of Right On! would have to do. But what if I did beg and begged because I was really good at being Michael Jackson? Would that have made a difference? Would she have sacrificed our little family to make my 7-year-old’s dream come true?
Ideally, a parent is a backstop against innocent fervor; against foolish, zealous choices and blissful ignorance. So I have to believe that my mother would have saved me from the hazards of my desire. That was her job. But that’s what adult Wade and James think their mothers’ job should have been, too. What’s still eating each woman up, toward the end of “Leaving Neverland,” is that neither woman disagrees.
It’s entirely possible that we’ve spent the last 26 years preparing for a moment like this — for somebody to lay it all out, graphically, frankly; for somebody to tell us a story, their story. For a long time, the chief teller of any such story was Jackson himself. He would install his sense of persecution into music videos, like the one for “Leave Me Alone,” from 1989, the finale of “Black or White,” from 1991, and “Ghosts,” from 1997, into songs like “Why You Wanna Trip on Me?” (1991), “Scream” (1995) and “They Don’t Care About Us” (1996). Very good songs, mostly about his tribulations as a so-called weirdo (the tabloids named him Wacko Jacko) and, especially, as a black man.
He tried, in highly rated television interviews, to let us see him as wounded and vulnerable and, well, normal. In 1993, he let Oprah Winfrey grill him (about the boys, but also about his altered appearance). He would let Martin Bashir do an occasionally pseudo-vérité version of the same, in a roving two-hour, 2003 TV documentary (“Living With Michael Jackson”) that exposes him as being helpless against himself. (There’s a long, astounding passage, for instance, in which Jackson leads a caravan of children on a Neverland excursion, and he seems taxed by such an overwhelming — and overwhelmingly absurd — babysitting assignment. Yet he’s able to bring himself to have one of his park’s homemade snow cones, anyway. It’s like the parody of Jackson’s hapless eccentricity you can see in Harmony Korine’s celebrity-impersonator film, “Mister Lonely,” and in the “Teddy Perkins” episode of FX’s “Atlanta.”) Then, after his arraignment in 2004, Jackson even danced, for appreciative fans, atop a car. Five years later he was dead.
The story was that Jackson never molested anybody. And we stuck to it, and it stuck to him. And the question now, of course, is what do we do? It’s the question of our #MeToo times: If we believe the accusers (and I believe Wade and James), what do we do with the art? With Jackson, what can we do? Wade became a successful choreographer who’s made a career out of teaching his version of Jackson’s hydraulic bounces, whips, and stutters to Britney Spears, ‘N Sync, Cirque du Soleil and rooms full of aspiring dancers. “Look Back at It,” the big single from A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie’s No. 1 album from January, is built out of two Jackson hits. Michael Jackson’s music isn’t a meal. It’s more elemental than that. It’s the salt, pepper, olive oil and butter. His music is how you start. And the music made from that — that music is everywhere, too. Where would the cancellation begin?
Jackson provided us an early occasion to ask the question about the art without ever realizing it was being asked. We simply lived with it, with the possibility of his guilt, and the many compartments we make to contain everything he was: the conscientious enthusiasm for and the comedy of him, the tragedy he so obviously represents. Perhaps we can live it because it’s not unreasonable to wonder whether he was living with the contradictions himself.
There is something about the way Jackson morphed from pretty to disfigured, closer to Joseph Merrick, the medical case study whose “elephant man” bones Jackson swore he never tried to buy. The morphing could have been a result of the pigmentation ailment, vitiligo, that he told Winfrey he suffered from. But what if all of that change he so notoriously underwent, all the damage he seemed to wear on his body, all the creatures his videos turned him into (werewolves, zombies, a panther, a skeleton), what if his outward self became some semiconscious manifestation of a monster that lurked within?
