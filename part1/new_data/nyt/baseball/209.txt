Opinion is divided on the Arizona Diamondbacks’ chances this year — they are talking about contending, though they are 30-1 to win their division. Arizona also traded its slugging first baseman, Paul Goldschmidt, to the Cardinals in the off season. Still, no matter what, the Diamondbacks can always count on their ace, Zack Greinke.
But the optimists were shaken on Thursday. Greinke didn’t look so good against the defending National League champion Dodgers on opening day, continuing a pattern of poor performances at Dodger Stadium since he left the team as a free agent after the 2015 season.
Greinke gave up seven runs in three and two-thirds innings, including four home runs. In all, the Dodgers had eight homers, breaking the opening-day record of six set by the 1988 Mets (Darryl Strawberry and Kevin McReynolds had two each that day) and tied by the White Sox last year. The homers also set a Dodger Stadium record. Only two teams, the 1987 Blue Jays and 1999 Reds, have ever hit more homers in a game.
The fourth inning was particularly ugly. The Dodgers, already ahead by 3-0, got back-to-back home runs by Enrique Hernandez and Austin Barnes, then a two-out blast by Corey Seager that finally chased Greinke. The final score was 12-5.
Greinke got taken deep off his faster pitches (Seager and Barnes) and his slower stuff (Hernandez and Joc Pederson).
“Off-speed wasn’t real sharp,” the laconic Greinke told reporters. “It was bad. Not really much to build off.”
Greinke, who faced boos from the home fans on Thursday, then cheers when he was bounced from the game, has struggled in Dodger Stadium since leaving there. His record there with the Diamondbacks stands at 1-4, with a 7.41 E.R.A. a particularly poor figure considering that the stadium has always been a pitcher’s park.
Though he has been an All-Star four of the last five seasons, Greinke is 35. If his poor performance in Los Angeles extends around the league, it could be a long year for the Diamondbacks.
