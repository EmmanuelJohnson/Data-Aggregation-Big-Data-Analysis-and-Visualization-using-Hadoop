PARKLAND, Fla. — On a day nobody wanted to remember — or forget — several people in maroon T-shirts emblazoned with #MSDStrong found their way Thursday to a place of solace: a flower garden outside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that, at the first anniversary of one of the nation’s deadliest school shootings, has sprouted to celebrate life.
A paramedic planted flowers in little plastic pots. A woman knelt to drop off a bouquet. A teenager strummed his guitar and sang. Then, he wept.
At 10:17 a.m., the time the local school district set to commemorate the 17 lives lost on Feb. 14, 2018, a man took off his purple cap.
“Moment of silence,” he said.
The crowd bowed its head.

Thursday could not possibly be a normal day in Parkland, Fla., where a still-grieving community coped by embracing the pain of it all.
Stoneman Douglas scheduled a “day of service and love.” Teachers organized community service projects, but attendance was voluntary. School buses arrived in the morning nearly empty. After early dismissal, students with school IDs hanging around their necks — a requirement since the shooting — streamed by the flower garden. Most hugged. A few cried. Therapy dogs brought in to help students heal last year came back down from Philadelphia for the anniversary and frolicked around the teenagers’ legs.
“After here, we’re going to the beach,” said Julia Brighton, a 16-year-old sophomore who was in the first classroom attacked last year. Two of her best friends, Alyssa Alhadeff and Gina Montalto, were killed. So was her neighbor, Alex Schachter. Julia said she could not see herself going to school on Thursday — only spending time with friends.
“Whenever I’m alone, I get in my head. It’s like having a weight on you,” she said. “I surround myself with a lot of positive people.”
In the evening, hundreds of people attended an interfaith vigil at nearby Pine Trails Park, an echo of the one a year ago, when the sound of gunfire was still fresh. Some people held single red roses or white carnations, which in any other context would have symbolized Valentine’s Day, a holiday that in this community may never be the same.
“Valentine’s Day has forever changed for us,” said the Rev. Randy Cutter of the Church by the Glades in Coral Springs, a town neighboring Parkland. “But it’s still about love — not romantic love, but the love that we have in our hearts for one another.”
Tears were plentiful, but so were the warm greetings among friends and neighbors happy to at least be together. As the sun went down, a crowd, hushed except for the sound of sniffles, listened to the victims’ names recited from stage.

“It’s hard to differentiate what’s from the shooting and what’s from regular teenage anxiety.” Four students who survived the massacre at their high school told us how it had changed them.
michael barbaro
From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: It’s been one year since the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland. “Daily” producer Clare Toeniskoetter went to Florida this week to check in on some of the students we met last year. It’s Thursday, February 14.
clare toeniskoetter
Last year, a few weeks after the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, my colleague Jack Healy went down to Parkland and interviewed a group of freshman girls who were in the first classroom that the shooter went into, classroom 1216.
student
I’ve thought about this, about being in a school shooting. And the one thing that I’ve always said that I would do is text my mom, “I love you,” and, like, “Thank you for everything.” And I was so mad at everything that I wasn’t going to be able to get to do that, and I was going to die and not let my mom know that I loved her.
clare toeniskoetter
And in that classroom, these girls saw eight of their classmates get shot.
student
And then I just hear a few shots happen over here. And then I see Alyssa, and she’s just standing like this. And then she, like, falls back.
clare toeniskoetter
And three of them were killed. So Jack interviewed the girls, but I was the producer working on “The Daily” episode. And over the past year, I just haven’t stopped thinking about them. I’ve thought about them each time there’s been another mass shooting. I’ve thought about them on election night. And I thought about them just pretty much every time I’ve seen a group of teenagers. So as we approach the one-year anniversary of the shooting, I wanted to check back in with them.

Please take a moment to locate the zone on your boarding pass.
clare toeniskoetter
So I flew down to Florida, got the group back together at one of their houses. They grabbed a few snacks. And they all settled in on a couch.
clare toeniskoetter (to the students)
Tell me who you each are.
jade
I’m Jade.
clare toeniskoetter
Jade. And Jade, how old are you?
jade
Uh, 15.
maddie
I’m Maddie and I’m 15.
clare toeniskoetter
Maddie.
brooke
I’m Brooke and I’m 15.
clare toeniskoetter
Brooke.
eden
Eden and I’m 15.
clare toeniskoetter
And Eden.
clare toeniskoetter (to the students)
And you’re about to turn 16?
eden
Yep.
clare toeniskoetter
And they immediately just started talking about the last time they were all here together in the same room.
eden
I feel like it’s like after you see somebody in a movie, and it’s during something, and then you know when they have the 10 years later, and they cut their hair, and they — I feel like that now.
jade
I mean, I did change my hair. [LAUGHTER]
eden
I feel like a different person than who I was when I was last sitting here.
clare toeniskoetter
What do you think you felt like then? What do you feel like now?
eden
I feel like now, I don’t know, in a way I feel burnt out a little, just like — I feel like I’ve been through hell. Like hell.
maddie
This year has been exhausting.
eden
And at that moment, I feel like I was so innocent.
clare toeniskoetter
What were those first weeks back like? So it was about halfway through the school year. And what was a typical day like? Did it feel like normal school at all?
brooke
No. Being together was the only good part about that.
eden
It was weird. Because the setting was different. And then it was just that feeling in the room.
jade
That emptiness.
eden
It’s like, oh my God, the kid who sat there died.
clare toeniskoetter
Was there ever a day when it felt normal, ever, like in your whole last school year?
brooke
It kind of never feels normal. We have a new normal, I feel like. My normal is seeing the 1200 building every day and having flashbacks and then moving on.
jade
Or like, oh, that happened.
brooke
Exactly.
eden
After three months, I would say, is when it wasn’t all we thought about all the time. Like that wasn’t the feeling I had.
jade
Like, summer was a good —
maddie
Summer was a good time.
clare toeniskoetter
Yeah?
maddie
Yeah, I’m not going to lie.
jade
Summer was like, I was at my happiest.
maddie
We were finally away from the building every day.
clare toeniskoetter
I wasn’t sure if summer would feel good or bad, being — because then you don’t have that built-in support group. But were you — did you stay with other Douglas students enough during your summers?
brooke
All of our friends and stuff like that completely understand. At least for me, I talk about it with them all the time. And I for sure feel like I can trust them more than I can a therapist. Because they understand me and they know me. So it’s a lot more personal.
clare toeniskoetter
So your friends who were also in school.
jade
Yeah, exactly.
eden
I don’t talk about it with anyone. Like, no one. I just can’t.
clare toeniskoetter
Not even friends?
eden
Not even my closest friend. It’s really hard for me to talk about it, because my closest friends, most of them weren’t in the building. And it’s just like, what is it going to help me to talk about it? They’re going to feel bad for me, and then what?
clare toeniskoetter
How’s it feel right now?
brooke
I think it’s different when there’s someone in the building. Because all of my friends that weren’t, they feel like they can’t even talk to me about their day, because they don’t want to make me feel bad that they’re talking about it — which, like, that sucks, because I want my friends to be able to talk to me about it. Like, I have no problem with people who weren’t in the building talking. Just don’t act like where I was and where you were is the same thing. That’s my only thing.
eden
Don’t even try to compare it. It’s just like, it’s different.
maddie
It’s different. It’s very, very different.
brooke
It’s completely different.
clare toeniskoetter
Shifting into the new school year, how did it feel coming back?
maddie
I hated it.
eden
It was awful.
clare toeniskoetter
Yeah?
jade
It was just like, oh, like, oh.
brooke
We’re back here?
clare toeniskoetter
So one of the things, from my understanding about going back to school last year, is everyone who was at the school was there on the day of the shooting. But then when you came back to school this year, for this new school year, there’s now a new class. There are freshmen who weren’t there. What is that like?
maddie
Not good.
clare toeniskoetter
Why?
brooke
The thing is, some of them are actually very nice and very understanding and accept the fact that they don’t know anything about it and they’re not going to ask, because they know it’s disrespectful. And then the other half are just —
maddie
Wish that they were there.
brooke
Just wish they were there and are trying so hard to get attention from it, in any way possible.
maddie
They post pictures of the building. [INTERPOSING VOICES] Like, you’ve never even —
eden
Have photoshoots.
brooke
And they think it’s funny.
maddie
You’ve never even been in the building. How are you going to post a picture of it?
jade
Unless their sibling was at open house, I don’t know.
brooke
But they think it’s funny. And they’re dropping textbooks, popping things.
maddie
Oh, my god.
brooke
Like, someone that has serious PTSD could be right next to you.
clare toeniskoetter
Wait, so they are walking through the halls and making loud noises, dropping textbooks. [INTERPOSING VOICES]
brooke
They do it in their classes all the time, for fun.
jade
I was taking a math test — it’s a thing.
clare toeniskoetter
That’s so cruel.
maddie
One of them, after the pep rally, I was walking back to class to portables, and we were right in front of the freshman building. And one of them popped a water bottle right in back of me. Right in front of the freshman building.
clare toeniskoetter
So it’s more than just one nasty kid. It’s a lot of them.
maddie
They just don’t have — they’re not considerate. They don’t know what they’re doing.
brooke
They don’t give empathy to the situation.
maddie
They don’t think about it.
brooke
Exactly. And it might be because they don’t really understand. But if you don’t understand, then just don’t do anything. Don’t try to be funny, because it’s not funny.
clare toeniskoetter
Yeah. It’s so — hearing you as sophomores talk about the freshmen, like, there’s this dynamic in any high school experience of feeling like, now I’m older and I hate those freshmen. But of course, it’s completely different for you.
brooke
— this whole separation, this whole divide.
eden
There’s a line.
maddie
I have no issue with them on any other problem, except for the shooting.
brooke
Anything else, I don’t even really care.
clare toeniskoetter
Yeah. What do you think is the ideal? What, if you were a freshman this year, what do you think would be the best way?
eden
Just don’t talk about it.
student
Just be respectful.
brooke
Don’t act like you know anything about it. Because you don’t. [INTERPOSING VOICES]
eden
Don’t bring it up. Ever.
maddie
Don’t talk about it like you know what we went through.
brooke
They don’t know anything.
maddie
Because I know that you were scared and you didn’t know what was going on.
clare toeniskoetter
Because a lot of them were next door in the middle school and got evacuated. But they weren’t —
eden
It was different.
jade
It was really scary for them. But for us, it’s terrifying.
brooke
It’s just different.
clare toeniskoetter
Yeah.
brooke
I heard it right in my ear, in the hallways. So don’t act like it’s the same.
clare toeniskoetter
Does all of this, does it make you feel older?
eden
I feel like I’m, like, a 90-year-old woman.
brooke
I feel like we didn’t really — we kind of fast-tracked. [INTERPOSING VOICES]
maddie
Yeah, telling stories about her life.
jade
And I feel really bad for —
brooke
I feel bad celebrating my birthday sometimes.
eden
I feel bad getting my license. I feel bad —
brooke
When they can’t —
clare toeniskoetter
Milestones. Every milestone feels —
eden
It’s really hard.
brooke
I just feel so guilty.
jade
Just getting up every day. Sometimes.
brooke
Like, they’re supposed to be here. Like, that whole thing wasn’t supposed to happen.
maddie
You gotta talk about it.
brooke
I kinda feel like our childhood got ruined.
jade
It did, yeah.
brooke
I feel like it’s not there anymore.
maddie
Like, our high school, everybody says high school is the best time of your life, along with college. But we don’t get that.
eden
But it’s not because it’s consuming our lives.
maddie
Yeah. It’s never going to be like that anymore. It’s never going to be like, oh, it’s high school.
brooke
Like, no cares in the world.
eden
When your parents are like, oh, when I was in high school, this. It’s like, when I was in high school, all I can think about would be the shooting.
jade
Yeah.
eden
It’s hard to differentiate what’s from the shooting and what’s from regular teenage anxiety. Because everybody has anxiety. Everybody. So for me, it’s like, I’ll get those times where I’ll feel like there’s literally — I’m just like, I can’t, I can’t. And I don’t know if it’s from the shooting, and I don’t know what it’s from.
brooke
It’s a combination of things, not just [INAUDIBLE] the shooting.
eden
That sets the basis for it.
maddie
Sometimes the stress of the shooting has a big impact on regular teenage stresses. So it’ll make your normal teenage stresses more stressful.
eden
Even more dramatic.
clare toeniskoetter
Because you guys are all 15, about to turn 16. So what’s going on in your lives outside of this? You’re about to get driver’s licenses.
jade
Yeah, exactly.
maddie
School.
clare toeniskoetter
Dating.
maddie
I mean, right now in life we’re worried about next year. Next year’s going to be our junior year, which is, like, the most important year.
clare toeniskoetter
College.
jade
Definitely, I’m thinking about that the most.
maddie
Starting to think about colleges, which is scary, but —
eden
So scary.
maddie
So scary.
brooke
And I’m really scared to apply to colleges, because I don’t want to be accepted just because I’m a Douglas kid. Like, I don’t want that to be the reason why —
eden
I don’t want that to be my —
brooke
I get above someone else.
eden
— the definition of who I am.
brooke
Exactly. I don’t want to look good to your college just because I was in the shooting.
eden
I just feel like time’s going by so fast.
jade
It really is. I can’t believe it’s almost been a year.
eden
It’s crazy.
jade
And that’s what I’m scared of.
brooke
I feel like it was, like, yesterday.
eden
That, to me, is crazy.
jade
Like, I relive it every day, for me at least.
maddie
I think because we’ve just been living in it this whole year, it just hasn’t gone away. It’s not something that —
jade
Like, it surrounds. When I look back on the person I was exactly a year ago from today, she would have not acted like this at all. She would have been a completely different person.
clare toeniskoetter
You think you were fundamentally changed?
jade
Yeah, definitely.
brooke
Yeah. I think everyone is. I don’t think anyone can mentally be the same after what we went through.
eden
It’s a part of you.
brooke
Exactly.
jade
Sometimes I’ll think about when I’m 20, I’ll think about, like, oh, that happened — what would that be? Seven years ago. Like, that’s scary.
maddie
Yeah. I think about when —
jade
It’s been that long.
maddie
— we have kids, how are we going to send our kids to school?
brooke
It’s so hard for me to want to have kids in a place like this.
maddie
How are we going to have kids and send them to school like that?
brooke
I’ve wanted kids my whole life. But I don’t know if I want them anymore.
eden
If my kid will have to go through what I went through, I’d just feel so bad.
brooke
It makes me not want to have kids. And I’ve wanted kids my whole life.
maddie
Obviously, in the very, very, very far future.
brooke
No, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
maddie
We’re talking about kids in the way future.
eden
Actually, six more months. [LAUGHTER] [MUSIC]
maddie
I always say this. I always say this. Everybody who goes through mass shootings don’t go to the site of the mass shooting every single day and see the building where it happened every single day. We do.
brooke
A part of me kind of wants to go in.
maddie
I want to go in so bad.
eden
I want to go in so bad. I still do.
maddie
I think we all agreed in 1216 —
brooke
It would give us nice closure.
maddie
— that we want to go in. [INTERPOSING VOICES]
eden
Last year, we were saying we all — I still want to go in.
jade
At the same time, I don’t want to see that.
brooke
Like, I want to —
maddie
I just want to see how they left it.
jade
Yeah, that’s what I want to see. I want to grab my English binder. [LAUGHTER]
eden
There’s just something so curious about how we went there every single day. I was in that building every single day.
brooke
I had, like, four classes in there.
jade
I had two.
eden
It’s so weird to me.
clare toeniskoetter
What do you think you would do if you could go in?
jade
Oh, I’d go in, just walk.
maddie
I would just walk. [INTERPOSING VOICES]
clare toeniskoetter
Together?
jade
The first thing I’d do is go in our classroom.
maddie
I’ve had dreams about —
eden
Me, too.
jade
I don’t want to see the blood stains.
brooke
I have it kind of engraved of a thought with just, like, Valentine’s stuff everywhere.
maddie
Or backpacks. Well, I guess we’re going to see it. We’re going to see it when the trial happens.
clare toeniskoetter
You’ll be able to go in?
maddie
No, we’re not going to be able to go in. But we’ll see pictures.
clare toeniskoetter
You’ll see photos.
brooke
I still want to see it for myself.
maddie
I know. [INTERPOSING VOICES]
brooke
Has anyone had time travel dreams or anything like that?
maddie
We sound like literal psychopaths right now. We sound like psychopaths.
jade
We sound insane.
clare toeniskoetter
Time travel dream?
brooke
Because I — it’s a recurring nightmare dream I have. I don’t really have anything about going forward. But I always have this dream where I’m able to go back to that date, and I try to warn people. And I try to warn Alaina, because she was my closest friend in that class. And she won’t listen to me. No one will listen to me.
eden
I had that, too. And I remember I had a dream, and I showed Alyssa my tattoo, because I have a tattoo.
clare toeniskoetter
What’s your tattoo of?
eden
It has the room number on it.
clare toeniskoetter
Do you all have them?
brooke
No.
eden
And I remember I was, in my dream, I was showing her. I was showing her in my dream. And she was, like —
maddie
Three hearts for them?
eden
Not believing me. And I was like, look, I’m telling you, there was a shooting. Don’t go to class. And she went anyways.
jade
I would have just, like, kidnapped her at the front, like, you’re coming with me.
eden
I didn’t know you got a tattoo.
clare toeniskoetter
Can you tell me what they both are?
maddie
Yeah. So mine is, the top is the date in Roman numerals, 2-14-18. The second layer is the three hearts for Alex, Alyssa and Alaina. And the third layer is 1216, which is our classroom number.
clare toeniskoetter
And what’s yours?
eden
And then mine is, like, a flower, which is kind of, if you see, there’s leaves on it. And that represents the growth from what happened. And then there’s the room number, 1216, and then there’s three little flower petals things, for Alaina, Alex and Alyssa.
maddie
Makes me feel close to them. I love that.
eden
I like it. But some days, I’m like, I wish I didn’t have to get this tattoo. Like, I hate how it’s part of, it’s permanent. And so is the shooting. It’s permanent on you. [INTERPOSING VOICES]
brooke
The thing is, I’m always going to think of it, and I want that there.
maddie
Yeah, I think the significance of getting something permanent on you is that just like the tattoo, the shooting is going to be with you for the rest of your life.
brooke
For the rest of your life. [MUSIC]
eden
For, like, three months after the shooting, I would always be searching up videos of the shooting and watching them over and over.
brooke
Same, same, same.
clare toeniskoetter
Why? [INTERPOSING VOICES]
eden
Because I needed, I needed that closure. I needed to actually see that was real.
brooke
I think that’s why a lot of us want to go in the room. We just want closure. Because I have no closure on anything.
eden
All we have is our memory. And that’s not as reliable, to me, as a picture. [INTERPOSING VOICES]
brooke
And that’s going to fade.
clare toeniskoetter
Do you think you’ll ever have closure?
eden
No.
brooke
Probably not.
eden
Maybe.
clare toeniskoetter
How could you have?
maddie
Hopefully.
eden
The building. The videos.
brooke
Like, I want to have closure. But I don’t know if it’s attainable.
eden
I think after the actual videos of it happening, I would love to see that.
jade
I started —
clare toeniskoetter
And that exists, in some —
eden
I think it will.
brooke
They exist.
eden
They have videos.
jade
I’ve seen a picture.
maddie
The hallway.
jade
But that’s it.
maddie
Well, I watch everything that comes out. Everything that comes out, I watch. Every article that comes out about it, I watch. Because I like to know everything that happened. Even though I know, I just don’t — I’d just like to —
eden
They don’t have the proof of it.
maddie
Because then I don’t look like an idiot telling my story, like, oh, yeah.
clare toeniskoetter
It’s validating.
maddie
Yeah. [MUSIC]
clare toeniskoetter
What are you planning on doing this Thursday?
maddie
Cemeteries. More cemeteries. Vigils. I’m going to two cemeteries.
jade
Are you going to Alyssa’s?
maddie
I’m going to — is Alex buried there?
eden
Yeah, they’re right next to — they’re right, literally so close to each other. I went to Alyssa’s, and I saw Max there. And I went to go see, and it was literally right next to it.
maddie
Is his headstone up?
eden
Yeah.
brooke
I want to visit Alaina’s, but —
maddie
I haven’t seen since his.
jade
Wait, where’s Alaina’s?
brooke
I don’t know where Alaina’s is.
maddie
I’m going to Martin’s and I’m going to Luke’s, which are both in the same — [SIGH]
clare toeniskoetter
And you don’t have school on Thursday. Friday is optional?
maddie
Optional.
jade
I mean, both of them is optional.
maddie
Yeah.
brooke
They’re both going to be there, but like —
clare toeniskoetter
You’re able to go and do service projects. Is that right? Are any of you going to go into school on Thursday?
maddie
No. I can’t. I couldn’t even stay for the rest of today.
eden
Yeah, today was hard.
maddie
I had to leave after third.
eden
I left early and came late.
jade
Are you going tomorrow?
maddie
No. I can’t. I physically, like, starting on Monday, I walked into school and I couldn’t.
jade
I feel like if I don’t, like, I don’t want to be at home thinking about it.
eden
Yeah. I don’t want to be home by myself.
jade
Oh, yeah, I know.
eden
I don’t like that.
maddie
I’d rather be home than there.
brooke
The thing is, I’ve already — I have so much makeup work.
jade
I feel like I have to go to school. It’s so bad.
brooke
I have so much makeup work because I’ve gone early for so many days, because of everything just being too much. And I feel like I can’t miss any more school because the amount of things I have to make up is insane.
maddie
Tomorrow is not going to be an academic day at all.
brooke
It is.
jade
Yeah. I’m learning a lesson in math.
brooke
I have things planned in bio.
jade
And I have homework over the weekend. And a test next week in there.
brooke
Same. [MUSIC]
clare toeniskoetter
What do you think that people get wrong about you? What do you think people should understand about you who were in the classroom?
maddie
Something that I’ve always wished that the media knew is that — what we went through, other than the politics. Not everything’s about March for Our Lives. And whereas March for Our Lives is great, and the fact that they can make a change is amazing. But we have stories that are worth being told. And I think that —
eden
And are worth hearing.
maddie
And I think that the media is just so quick to politicize everything, because that’s what makes everything a story. But not everything’s political, and we’re actually going through something that’s real. And really bad.
eden
And it’s happening.
maddie
Yeah, and it happened to us.
brooke
And it happened when we were, like, 14 or 15.
eden
That’s what’s so amazing about what the March for Our Lives kids did. But now over time, it’s obviously getting less of a national discussion, less important in our conversations right now.
jade
Less vital.
eden
Which is upsetting.
brooke
I feel like another thing, too, is — especially with a bunch of news stations and stuff like that — because I feel like a lot of people forget. And I wish people knew that just because the cameras went away and people aren’t writing about it as much does not mean that the issue went away. Like, people are still depressed. People are still having panic attacks and anxiety attacks. And there are still people that can’t go throughout the day without breaking down because of this. And they didn’t just like, poof, when the camera stopped reporting them or their interview ended — nothing stopped.
clare toeniskoetter
What do you hope comes out of someone knowing that, of fully understanding your story of being in the room?
maddie
For me, it’s more about memorializing them and remembering them. Because that’s what matters. To me, that’s what matters, is to keep —
eden
To make sure their names aren’t forgotten.
jade
To keep them alive.
maddie
Because they didn’t deserve to die. And they’re not here to share their stories.
brooke
But we can do that for them. And I think that’s the only reason that —
jade
In a non-political way.

— exactly — is that we just want their name to be there forever. They didn’t go away. They’re going to be there with us in our memories as long as we live. And we, as the people who survived it, can bring their memory to life to other people and to show them how amazing they were. They didn’t meet them. But we hope that by telling you how smart Alaina was, by telling you how kind Alex was, by telling you how funny Alyssa was, that you can understand.

O.K., so there’s two options here with mirrors. [INTERPOSING VOICES]
Many of the victims’ families made a joint public appearance on Wednesday after meeting with Gov. Ron DeSantis. Some of the families have pushed for the state to hold more local officials accountable for what happened.
“They’ve had a year to fix Broward County and make our schools safer,” said Max Schachter, Alex’s father. “This is ground zero, and they continue to fail us.”
But Mr. DeSantis, who suspended former Sheriff Scott Israel last month over his handling of the shooting, told them he will not remove Superintendent Robert W. Runcie of the Broward County Public Schools because Mr. Runcie is appointed by elected school board members — several of whom were re-elected last fall. Instead, Mr. DeSantis asked the Florida Supreme Court to impanel a grand jury to investigate security across the state’s public school districts, with a focus on Broward.
President Trump pledged on Wednesday to keep schools safe. “Our entire nation mourns for the victims and their loved ones,” he told a sheriffs’ association.
Outside Stoneman Douglas on Thursday, news crews lined up to broadcast from the scene. Survivors suffering from the lingering effects of trauma had asked that media helicopters, whose rotors trigger reminders of the day of the shooting, stay away, and they did.
“I haven’t been able to drive down this street for a year,” said Gibson Sylvestre, a Parkland resident whose sister graduated from Stoneman Douglas in the late 1990s. “Today I said, ‘You know what? If all these kids can come here, then I can come here.’ It’s been devastating.”
“It’s a very emotional day,” said Mirella Ortiz, 39, who brought her three young children to the memorial garden to pay their respects. The family moved to Parkland for its excellent public schools — especially Stoneman Douglas — and Ms. Ortiz’s younger sister was a senior on the day of the shooting. “She wanted to be home today,” she said. “And we chose to be here.”
Some students gathered for private moments of remembrance. Ronit Reoven, an advanced placement psychology teacher who lost one student, Carmen Schentrup, and had three others injured, had to pick up platters for a picnic that her students from that day organized at a nearby park. The group has gathered periodically over the past year, over doughnuts, sushi and Mexican food, she said.
“Someone can say, ‘I had a bad dream,’ and they all get each other,” Ms. Reoven said.
Her departure to the picnic kept getting delayed by reporters asking about the memorial garden she planted with one of her students, Tori Gonzalez, and by students and parents wrapping her in bear hugs. “I just can’t believe it’s been a year, because it still feels fresh,” she said.
Jon Faber, 50, reminded others in the community that Ms. Reoven, 47, saved the life of his son’s best friend: She tied a tourniquet on Ben Wikander’s arm using a baby blanket she used in her classroom to cover a Keurig coffee machine.
“It’s not normal, for 17 people to die in school,” Mr. Faber said.
Another one of his son’s friends, Sammy Feuerman, 18, who graduated from Stoneman Douglas last year, drove down from Florida State University in Tallahassee to be in Parkland for the anniversary. “I just felt I needed to be here,” he said.
Sometimes he wears Stoneman Douglas T-shirts in college and “people nod their heads in respect,” Mr. Feuerman said. “I used to say I’m from Fort Lauderdale, I’m from Boca, because no one knew Parkland. Now I say Parkland.”
The anniversary made Mr. Feuerman reminisce about the day before the shooting, which was the last time he played basketball with Joaquin Oliver before he was killed. Days after that, Mr. Feuerman had made his way to the State Capitol to implore lawmakers to tighten Florida’s gun laws. Now, he’s studying criminology, a decision he made after the shooting.
“I definitely want to do something where I can prevent bad things from happening,” he said. “People should know that Douglas and Parkland are not going away anytime soon.”
