Adolescence is fraught with dangers, not the least of which are teenagers’ assumptions of their own immortality — how could anything stop such vibrant corporeal glory? But parents know how swiftly tragedy can strike and how accidental its targets may be. For many a young black man in our polarizing society, coincidence has become a sustained peril. The mother in January Gill O’Neil’s poem can only watch with her ferocious love and bottomless terror as her son plunges down the path that will shape him; a child simply trying to grow up into a man. Selected by Rita Dove
A gray hoodie will not protect my sonfrom rain, from the New England cold.I see the partial eclipse of his faceas his head sinks into the half-darkand shades his eyes. Even in ourquiet suburb with its unlocked doors,I fear for his safety — the darkest childon our street in the empire of blocks.Sometimes I don’t know who he is anymoretraveling the back roads between boy and man.He strides a deep stride, pounds a basketballinto wet pavement. Will he take his shotor is he waiting for the open-mouthedorange rim to take a chance on him? I singhis name to the night, ask for safe passagefrom this borrowed body into the nextand wonder who could mistake himfor anything but good.
