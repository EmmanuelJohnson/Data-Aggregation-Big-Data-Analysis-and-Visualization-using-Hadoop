In the face of flagging iPhone sales, Apple unveiled an audacious plan yesterday to dominate the digital services that run on its devices — a new monthly subscription service for TV programming, video games and news, as well as a new credit card. But it failed to spell out why anyone should take the company up on its offer.
• Apple TV Plus will offer new original content, as well as programs from channels like HBO and Showtime. Reese Witherspoon, Steven Spielberg and Jennifer Aniston took the stage to make the announcement, but details — even about fundamentals like pricing — were glaringly absent.
• Apple News Plus gives access to 300 magazines, including The New Yorker and National Geographic, as well as newspapers like the LAT and the WSJ for $9.99 a month. But it’s unclear whether you’ll get all the content — business stories and analysis will remain exclusive to full WSJ subscribers, who pay $39 a month, for example — so it’s not quite as robust an offering as it first seems.
• Apple Arcade is a video game subscription service that will launch later this year. Surprise: No details were given about how much it would cost, or which games would be included.
• Apple Card is the company’s new credit card, which has been developed with Goldman Sachs. It’s meant to work mainly on the iPhone, with users receiving 2 percent cash back on the same day if they make purchases through Apple Pay. Some important questions you might have — such as credit limit and interest rate — weren’t answered.
The company is betting that consumers will be tempted by the convenience (and, presumably, slick experience) of having one company provide every scrap of content to them. But its success will rest on the quality of the content and the value on offer — and we still have little idea about either.
Lobbyists for clients like Uber and Handy are pressing legislatures to keep workers from being deemed employees, Noam Scheiber of the NYT writes:
• In December, a Texas regulator proposed that companies using a “digital network” to dispatch workers, as Uber does with car drivers, could label them contractors rather than employees.
• That’s a big deal for gig-economy companies, who want to designate workers as contractors to avoid paying unemployment insurance and overtime, saving billions.
• This month, it came to light that Tusk Ventures, a venture-capital and political-strategy firm, appears to have been the primary author of the Texas proposal.
• Tusk was retained by the on-demand cleaning and repairs company Handy, and is run by Bradley Tusk, once a top political consultant for Uber and a large shareholder who could make millions when the company goes public.
• Tusk has also pursued similar efforts in other states, like Illinois.
• “Worker advocacy groups say the goal is to chip away at classification rules in enough places to create pressure for a broad exemption nationally,” Mr. Scheiber writes.
Last year, Michael Avenatti became a celebrity for representing Stormy Daniels, the adult film star, in her fight against President Trump. Yesterday, he was arrested for what prosecutors said was an attempted shakedown of Nike.
Mr. Avenatti threatened the sports giant, saying he would release evidence showing that its employees had given money to college recruits — unless he and an unnamed client were paid at least $22.5 million, prosecutors said.
“The company will die — not die, but they are going to incur cut after cut after cut after cut, and that’s what’s going to happen as soon as this thing becomes public,” Mr. Avenatti told Nike lawyers in a meeting that was recorded.
The federal charges were announced around the time that Mr. Avenatti tweeted that he planned to hold a news conference to accuse Nike of “a major high school/college basketball scandal.”
“When lawyers use their law licenses as weapons, as a guise to extort payments for themselves, they are no longer acting as attorneys,” Geoffrey Berman, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said yesterday.
Britain’s lawmakers grabbed control of the nation’s departure from the E.U. yesterday, in a move that highlights the struggles of Prime Minister Theresa May, Stephen Castle of the NYT reports.
Parliament gave itself power to vote on alternative Brexit plans. “Its attempt to take control of the process came as Mrs. May prepared for a last-ditch effort to persuade lawmakers to support her withdrawal plan, which has already been rejected twice by huge margins,” Mr. Castle writes.
It will hold a series of votes tomorrow on alternatives to Mrs. May’s plan. “These could include a so-called ‘soft Brexit’ that would keep Britain tied into European economic structures; a second referendum, revoking Brexit completely; or leaving without any deal,” Mr. Castle explains.
“Mrs. May said she could not commit to honoring the outcome of any of these nonbinding parliamentary votes, particularly if they contradicted the pro-Brexit stance in the Conservative Party’s manifesto for the 2017 general election.”
But the situation challenges Britain’s political traditions, where the government normally controls the agenda in Parliament, and “could create a constitutional showdown,” according to Mr. Castle.
The ride-hailing giant said this morning that it will acquire Careem, its main competitor in the region, for $3.1 billion, Kate Conger of the NYT reports.
The deal comes ahead of Uber’s I.P.O., and could give a boost to the company’s financial prospects in the region by eliminating a rival. It also gives Uber immediate access to several markets where it doesn’t currently operate, including Iraq, Morocco and Palestine.
The deal represents a change in strategy, since Uber has largely sought to form joint ventures with international rivals like Didi Chuxing of China and Yandex of Russia.
But it could raise privacy concerns, Ms. Conger writes. Careem will keep operating under its own name, but will eventually share some features with Uber. Though Uber has declined to share user data with the Egyptian government, Careem was more open to doing so.
At the center of the college bribery scheme that ensnared celebrities and financiers is Rick Singer, a higher-education guru who said he was able to get applicants into top schools. The WSJ traced one way he operated: partnering with financial advisory firms.
• He was a regular on the financial speaking circuit, the WSJ reports, “which allowed Mr. Singer to move through elite circles in finance, tech and entertainment.” His services often spread through word of mouth.
• “Mr. Singer listed work with other financial-services firms, including Oppenheimer and Morgan Stanley, on his website and social media.”
• “Employees at bond-fund giant Pacific Investment Management Co., based in Newport Beach, Calif., twice invited Mr. Singer to speak about the college-admission process, and the company said some there used his legitimate services.” (Douglas Hodge, the former C.E.O. of Pimco, as the company is known, has been charged in the bribery scheme.)
• “In November 2017, for instance, an employee at a Los Angeles-based financial adviser emailed Mr. Singer, introducing him to a parent who wished to make a ‘donation’ to ‘one of those top schools’ for his daughter, according to federal filings, which don’t name the firm.”
DE Shaw may be best known as the hedge fund where Jeff Bezos began his career. But as Robin Wigglesworth of the FT writes, it was also an early leader in computer-driven investing — and is now betting on A.I.-enabled stock picking.
• “Many in the industry believe this is the future, and are rushing to hire computer scientists to help realize the benefits of big data and artificial intelligence in their strategies.”
• “People have gone insane about this, but in a good way,” Eric Schmidt, the former Google executive chairman who owns 20 percent of DE Shaw, told the FT. “We are at the beginning of a new era in artificial intelligence. These technologies should benefit investing as well.”
• DE Shaw keeps its operations shrouded in secrecy. “They’re really smart, but I’ve never quite understood them,” one quant hedge fund manager told the FT.
• But there’s reason to be skeptical of its current approach, Mr. Wigglesworth writes. “Wall Street has seen several cycles of quant hype before, and many remain skeptical that traditional firms can retool their culture sufficiently to unlock the potential advantages of a more hybrid approach.”
• “Some rivals question whether it has departed too far from its roots. For instance, Two Sigma — a major quant hedge fund started by former senior DE Shaw executives — has eschewed their former colleagues’ hybrid methods.”
Seth DuCharme, the chief of the criminal division for the U.S. attorney’s office for the Eastern District of New York, will join the staff of Attorney General William Barr. Jacquelyn Kasulis, who led the prosecution of Martin Shkreli, will become the acting chief of the division.
The investment bank Perella Weinberg Partners has hired Nancy Boehm from the CIT Group as a managing director and its chief technology officer.
