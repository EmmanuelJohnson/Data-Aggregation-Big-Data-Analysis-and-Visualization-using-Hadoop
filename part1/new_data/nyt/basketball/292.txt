Alexa Willard scored 17 points to help 11th-seeded Missouri State stun third-seeded Iowa State by 69-60 on Monday, becoming the only double-digit seed to reach this year’s Round of 16.
Abby Hipp had 11 points and Danielle Gitzen scored 10 for the Lady Bears (25-9), who will compete in a regional semifinal for the first time since the Jackie Stiles-led team in 2001. They will face either Stanford or Brigham Young in Chicago after becoming the ninth team in 10 years to reach the Round of 16 as a double-digit seed.
Iowa State (26-9) played much of the fourth quarter within a possession of the lead, only to let Missouri State answer time and time again. Sydney Manning extended the Lady Bears’ lead to 60-54 on a 3-pointer, her only field goal of the game, and Willard followed with a jumper.
Gitzen answered an empty Cyclones possession with two free throws, and Bridget Carleton threw the ball away at the 1:07 mark with Iowa State down by 65-58. The Cyclones then inexplicably failed to foul Missouri State, allowing the Lady Bears to burn nearly 30 seconds off the clock.
Carleton had 31 points in her final game to lead Iowa State, which shot a ghastly 2 of 17 on 3s and 35.6 percent overall.
Missouri State controlled the first half, jumping ahead by 33-30 at the break after Iowa State — which averages 8.9 3-pointers a game — missed its first five tries from deep. A 10-2 run to open the second half gave the Lady Bears a 43-32 lead midway through the third quarter.
Finally faced with the idea that their Cyclones were in trouble, Iowa State’s fans got into the act. The Cyclones followed, reeling off nine quick points to make it a one-possession game. But a crucial 3 by Willard helped Missouri State push its lead to 49-45 entering the final quarter.
It might have seemed as though a game-deciding run was inevitable for the Cyclones. But it was the Lady Bears, fresh off a dominant win over sixth-seeded DePaul, who took control when it mattered.
The jubilant Bears ran into the crowd to celebrate with their band after the final horn, and a few of them picked up coach Kellie Harper’s son in celebration while screaming “We’re going to Chicago!”
Juicy Landrum scored 20 points with four 3-pointers and No. 1 overall seed Baylor advanced to the Round of 16 for the 11th season in a row with a 102-63 win over California on Monday night.
The Big 12 champion Lady Bears (33-1) were trailing late in the first quarter before a 25-2 run turned their third N.C.A.A. meeting in six seasons against Cal into yet another lopsided victory. They have a 25-game winning streak.
Chloe Jackson, the first graduate transfer to play for Baylor, scored eight of her 18 points in that big run and finished 8-of-12 shooting. Freshman NaLyssa Smith had 13 points and Lauren Cox had 10 on 5-of-6 shooting.
Michaela Onyenwere scored a career-high 30 points, Japreece Dean added 22 and U.C.L.A. squeezed past No. 3 seed Maryland, 85-80, Monday night to earn its fourth consecutive berth in the Round of 16 of the women’s N.C.A.A. tournament.
Dean, the smallest player on the court, sank two free throws with 25 seconds remaining to make it 83-79, and the Bruins held on to beat the Terrapins on their own court.
Sixth-seeded U.C.L.A. (22-12) will next face second-seeded Connecticut (33-2) on Friday in the semifinal round of the Albany region.
U.C.L.A. collected 27 offensive rebounds and finished with 27 second-chance points.
Madison Guebert scored 18 of her 20 points on 3-pointers, including two critical 3s in the fourth quarter, to lead No. 6 South Dakota State to a 75-64 win over third-seeded Syracuse on Monday night.
The victory sends the Jackrabbits (28-6) to the Round of 16 for the first time in program history. They will face No. 2 Oregon on Friday in the regional semifinals in Portland, Ore.
Guebert had 14 of her points in the second half. Myah Selland added 17 for South Dakota State, Macy Miller had 11, and Paiton Burckhard 10.
Arike Ogunbowale scored 23 points and two teammates had double-doubles as top-seeded Notre Dame ran away from No. 9 Michigan State in the first half of a 91-63 victory Monday night in the N.C.A.A. Chicago regional.
Jackie Young gave coach Muffet McGraw and the Purcell Pavilion crowd a scare when she fell hard to the floor just seconds before the end of the third quarter. She was O.K. and finished with 21 points, 11 rebounds and 7 assists for the Fighting Irish, who are in the Round of 16 for the 10th straight season. They will play No. 4 Texas A&M Saturday at Wintrust Arena in Chicago.
