Jim Boeheim, the longtime men’s basketball coach at Syracuse, struck and killed a pedestrian on Wednesday night, the police said.
A man had been involved in an earlier accident and had left his car on I-690 near Syracuse. Boeheim drove by later, striking the man, the police said.
The victim was Jorge Jimenez, 51, of Syracuse. A police statement said Boeheim had tried to avoid the disabled car in the middle of the road and as a result had “struck the victim who was standing on the side of the road.”
A police statement said that neither driver was impaired by drugs or alcohol. It said Boeheim’s speed had not been determined. While no tickets had been issued, an investigation was being conducted, it said.
The area was under a weather advisory for snow and ice conditions.
“I am heartbroken that a member of our community died as the result of last night’s accident,” Boeheim said in a statement. “Juli and I extend our deepest sympathies to the Jimenez family. Out of respect for those involved, I will not be providing further comment at this time.”
“We are saddened by the death of a member of our Central New York community,” said John Wildhack, the Syracuse athletic director. “Coach Boeheim is in contact with local authorities and cooperating fully.”
Boeheim, 74, has been the coach at Syracuse since 1976, winning a national championship in 2003 and logging four other Final Four appearances over the years.
Earlier in the evening, Syracuse (18-8) had beaten No. 18 Louisville, 69-49.
