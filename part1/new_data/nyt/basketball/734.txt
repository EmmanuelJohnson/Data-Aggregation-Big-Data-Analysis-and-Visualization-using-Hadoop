Botticelli is in Boston, kimonos are in San Francisco, and dinosaurs are standing tall on both coasts. Here are a few of the new museum exhibitions this spring.

CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA.
“Sometimes. We. Cannot. Be. With. Our. Bodies.”
Through July 7

Vanessa German, who makes her home and art in Pittsburgh now, says she created this immersive two-gallery sound, sculpture and text installation as a reaction to the deaths — and often unsolved murders — of African-American women and girls. Some figures in this work have no heads; some heads have no bodies; some hands are balled into fists; and found objects are everywhere. “I think of it,” she has said, “as an act of restorative justice.” Fralin Museum of Art at the University of Virginia, 155 Rugby Road, 434-924-3592, uvafralinartmuseum.virginia.edu/
DALLAS
“Hands and Earth: Contemporary Japanese Ceramics”
Through Jan. 5

The organizers describe this show’s theme as “avant-garde approaches to clay” over the last 80 years. Of the 35 or so artists represented here, most are living and still creating art, but their works mirror artistic traditions millenniums old. Crow Museum of Asian Art, 2010 Flora Street, 214-979-6430, crowcollection.org
HOUSTON
“Epidemic! Presents: Step and Screw: Trenton Doyle Hancock”
Through May 19

A series of 30 works on paper. Mr. Hancock, who grew up in Paris, Tex., in the 1980s, makes a statement about racial injustice with his combination of comic book formatting and historical inscriptions. And the whole thing — featuring Torpedo Boy, Mr. Hancock’s alter ego, and an invasion of hooded Ku Klux Klansmen — is installed in a shed with one lone light bulb in the center of the gallery. Menil Collection, 1533 Sul Ross Street, 713-525-9400, menil.org
NASHVILLE
“Van Gogh, Monet, Degas and Their Times: The Mellon Collection of French Art”
Through May 5

Lots of Impressionism, of course, but that’s not all. Visitors to this show, from Paul and Rachel Mellon and the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond, will also find Romanticism, Cubism and other styles. Picasso’s name didn’t make it into the title, but his work is here, too. Frist Art Museum, 919 Broadway, 615-244-3340, fristartmuseum.org
VERO BEACH, FLA.
“Victorian Radicals: From the Pre-Raphaelites to the Arts & Crafts Movement”
Through May 5

Not everyone in 19th-century England was in love with the changing world brought on by the Industrial Revolution. Some artists rejected change by turning back to medieval Europe for inspiration. This expansive show offers 145 paintings, drawings, sculptures and other works from rebels including Dante Gabriel Rossetti, John Everett Millais and William Morris. Vero Beach Museum of Art, 3001 Riverside Park Drive, 772-231-0707, vbmuseum.org
WEST PALM BEACH, FLA.
“Out of the Box: Camera-less Photography”
Through June 18

Who needs a traditional camera to create photos? The Norton, which reopened on Feb. 9 after a major expansion, is presenting about 50 works to reflect the many ways to record images. And no, iPhone shots don’t count. The show includes “rayograms” by Man Ray as well as works by Robert Heinecken, Walead Beshty and the British inventor William Henry Fox Talbot. Norton Museum of Art, 1450 South Dixie Highway, 561-832-5196, norton.org

DENVER
“Jordan Casteel: Returning the Gaze”
Through Aug. 18

She’s a Denver native, and this is her first major museum exhibition. Ms. Casteel, who now lives and works in Harlem, is showing nearly 30 paintings (2014-18), larger-than-life portraits based on her photos of city scenes (from “Harlem and elsewhere,” the artist said when we asked), local business owners and the like. Denver Art Museum, 100 West 14th Avenue Parkway, 720-865-5000, denverartmuseum.org
LOS ANGELES
“Antarctic Dinosaurs”
April 3-Jan. 5, 2020

The first thing you need to know: During the Triassic Period, Antarctica was not covered with glaciers, so it’s safe to say that these ancient creatures were not swathed in fur. This show, which recreates an expedition, includes a fossil skull of a newly discovered sauropodomorph (your children know that they were tall vegetarians and ate from the tops of trees). Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, 900 Exposition Boulevard, 213-763-3466, nhm.org
SAN FRANCISCO
“Kimono Refashioned”
Through May 5

You can find Japanese kimonos in art at least as far back as A.D. 800. This exhibition, with more than 35 garments from the Kyoto Costume Institute, shows how fashion designers around the world have — much more recently — borrowed from and adapted the kimono’s fabrics, silhouettes and decorative motifs. One of the oldest pieces is a bustle gown made in London in the 1870s. Visitors can compare it with a 1910 British evening dress of cut velvet, twill and organdy; a 1995 Yohji Yamamoto dress with a black bodice and red and gold brocade skirt; a 1991 strapless black silk taffeta Commes des Garçons Noir dress with a hand-painted skirt; and kimono-influenced designs from Alexander McQueen and Tom Ford. Asian Art Museum, 200 Larkin Street, 415-581-3500, asianart.org
SANTA FE, N.M.
“Alexander Girard: A Designer’s Universe”
May 5-Oct. 27

This is the first major retrospective for Mr. Girard, a hero in Santa Fe who died in 1993 and has his own wing here. There are textiles, furniture, sculpture, sketches, drawings and collages showing, as the museum says, “a passion for colors, ornamentation and inspirations from folk art.” Mr. Girard hated object labels and refused them in his wing, but this show does have normal labels. Organized by the Vitra Design Museum of Weil am Rhein, Germany. Museum of International Folk Art, 706 Camino Lejo (Museum Hill), 505-476-1200, internationalfolkart.org
SEATTLE
“Jeffrey Gibson: Like a Hammer”
Through May 12
Gay club culture meets powwow regalia in the work of Mr. Gibson, an American of Cherokee heritage who grew up all over the world (England, Germany, South Korea and the United States). The exhibition includes more than 65 works, all done since 2011, among them wall hangings, abstract paintings (on rawhide and canvas), beaded punching bags and performance video. Look for song lyrics too, in the text and titles. Seattle Art Museum, 1300 First Avenue, 206-654-3100, seattleartmuseum.org
STANFORD, CALIF.
“Josiah McElheny: Island Universe”
Through Aug. 18

What’s physics got to do with it? Mr. McElheny’s installation — chromed metal, handblown glass and lights — uses precise mathematical calculations to comment on various theories of the universe, including the Big Bang theory and the multiverse concept. If the five hanging chandeliers remind you of the Metropolitan Opera at Lincoln Center in Manhattan, that’s not an accident. The artist had a special consultant on this project: an astronomy professor. Cantor Arts Center, 328 Lomita Drive (at Museum Way), 650-498-1480, museum.stanford.edu

BOSTON
“Botticelli: Heroines and Heroes”
Through May 19

There you are, enjoying life in Renaissance Florence and redecorating your home. Because you can afford a Botticelli spalliera — a horizontal piece of art on paneling that’s all the rage — you buy it and hang it above a bench or use it as a bed headboard. “The Story of Lucretia” and “The Story of Virginia” (both tempera, circa 1500) are the centerpieces here, and their statements are artistic and, in a disturbing new way, political. “It’s as though someone has finally turned on the lights” about centuries-old misogynist messages, the Boston Globe review suggested when the show opened on Feb. 14. “Women are being raped and murdered, and society’s somehow the better for it.” Karl Stevens, a 21st-century graphic novelist, has done cartoon versions of the two works, but from the women’s point of view and with text. Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, 25 Evans Way; 617-566-1401, gardnermuseum.org
NEW YORK
“Stonewall 50 at New-York Historical Society”
May 24-Sept. 22

In June 1969, when police officers raided the Stonewall Inn, a Greenwich Village gay bar, something unexpected happened. The bar patrons, including more than a few drag queens, fought back, and the modern gay rights movement was born. This is a three-part 50th-anniversary commemoration, with the exhibitions “Letting Loose and Fighting Back: LGBTQ Nightlife Before and After Stonewall”; “By the Force of Our Presence: Highlights From the Lesbian Herstory Archives”; and a new installation, “Say It Loud, Out and Proud,” with images from a half century of gay pride marches. New-York Historical Society, 170 Central Park West (at 77th Street), 212-873-3400, nyhistory.org
NEW YORK
“T. Rex: The Ultimate Predator”
Through Aug. 9, 2020

For a long time, this Upper West Side museum has been a special place to look at dinosaurs. Now, for the next year and a half, it also has a show celebrating the scariest of them all. If you had met a typical Tyrannosaurus rex (maybe in Montana or the Dakotas), it would have been at least 40 feet long and 12 feet tall (imagine two city buses on top of each other) with teeth so sharp they could bite through bones. This show offers models, fossils, casts and some virtual reality experiences, so visitors can pretend they live in the Cretaceous period. American Museum of Natural History, Central Park West and 79th Street, 212-769-5100, amnh.org
PHILADELPHIA
“Sara Berman’s Closet: A Small and Monumental Story”
April 5-Sept. 1

When Sara Berman was 60 and living in Israel — far from her Belarus birthplace — she left her husband and moved into a studio apartment in Greenwich Village. She also decided to start wearing only white. This tribute, a re-creation of her clothes closet and more, is from her daughter, the artist Maira Kalman, and her grandson, Alex Kalman, who say people’s everyday belongings convey major messages. The closet will be displayed outdoors on Kimmel Plaza. Inside, in the fifth-floor gallery, a show of paintings, texts and ephemera will look at Berman’s life journey. She died in 2004. National Museum of American Jewish History, 101 South Independence Mall East, 215-923-3811, nmajh.org
PROVIDENCE, R.I.
“Gorham Silver: Designing Brilliance: 1850-1970”
May 3-Dec. 1

Are forks, knives and soup spoons works of art? The subject here is Gorham silver, made in Providence since the 1830s and used in dining rooms, including Mary Todd Lincoln’s in the White House. But the show is much more than table settings. It includes 19th-century water pitchers, tureens, ice bowls, nutcrackers, fruit stands and epergnes (centerpieces), and 19th- and 20th-century tea and coffee services. Some individual utensils are standouts, too, like the 1879 unicorn-head egg spoon, the 19th-century souvenir teaspoon topped by a silver whaling ship and the 1893 bonbon spoon accented with enamel the colors of peacock feathers. Rhode Island School of Design Museum, 20 North Main Street, 401-454-6500, risdmuseum.org
WASHINGTON
“Tintoretto: Artist of Renaissance Venice”
March 24-July 7

How old does a man have to be to get his first North American retrospective? Jacopo Tintoretto would have celebrated his 500th birthday this year, and he’s having his — with close to 50 paintings and 10 drawings, including some loans of works never seen in the United States. If you missed this show, which includes portraits of aristocrats and mythological narratives, at the Palazzo Ducale in Venice, this may be your last chance. National Gallery of Art, National Mall (Constitution Avenue N.W. between Third Street and Ninth Street), 202-737-4215, nga.gov

CHICAGO
“Manet and Modern Beauty”
May 26-Sept. 8

In the late 1870s and early 1880s, when Édouard Manet was in his later years (he was 51 when he died in 1883), he suddenly turned from painting historical and heroical art to creating studies of contemporary female beauty, often in watercolors and pastels. He had begun a four-season series, and two of this exhibition’s standouts are the two completed portraits: “Autumn (Méry Levant),” showing her in a dark brown fur; and “Jeanne (Spring),” showing Jeanne Demarsy, an actress, in a light floral print, holding a parasol. Bonus: Rarely seen letters of Manet’s featuring his drawings. This is the museum’s first all-Manet show in more than half a century. Art Institute of Chicago, 111 South Michigan Avenue, 312-443-3600, artic.edu
CHICAGO
“Prisoner of Love”
Through Oct. 27

Bruce Nauman’s neon piece “Life, Death, Love, Hate, Pleasure, Pain” spells out the three word-paired themes of this exhibition. Three groups of artworks rotating throughout the run include pieces by Robert Mapplethorpe, Marilyn Minter and Glenn Ligon. And at all times, “Love Is the Message, The Message Is Death,” Arthur Jafa’s seven-minute film, will be playing. It includes footage of concerts, news reports, sports matches, stars like Beyoncé and speeches by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Barack Obama. The theme: trauma and transcendence. Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, 220 East Chicago Avenue, 312-280-2660, mcachicago.org
CLEVELAND
“Shinto: Discovery of the Divine in Japanese Art”
April 9-June 30

The word Shinto means “way of the gods,” and this show includes about 125 works of art from the Heian through Edo periods (A.D. 794-1868). Some works, including costumes and paintings, are from Japanese shrines and temples. Cleveland Museum of Art, 11150 East Boulevard, 877-262-4748, clevelandart.org
DETROIT
“Daniel Arsham: The Source: A Catalog of Late-20th-Century American Relics”
Through June 23

On the lower level of this suburban museum, visitors are asked to pretend to be people from the future looking at objects, mostly from the 1990s, seemingly petrified and with parts missing as if unearthed from the ruins of some catastrophe. It’s part of Mr. Arsham’s “Future Archaeology” project; his future relics include “Rose Quartz Eroded Blockbuster Video,” “Gray Selenite Eroded Air Max” and “Ash and Pyrite Eroded Basketballs.” The trailer for a pretend Juliette Lewis movie to open in 2089 sets the scene. Cranbrook Art Museum, 39221 Woodward Avenue, Bloomfield Hills, 248-645-3320, cranbrookartmuseum.org
MINNEAPOLIS
“Hearts of Our People: Native Women Artists”
June 2-Aug. 18

Not just a women’s show and not just a Native American show, this 115-work exhibition includes sculpture, textiles, decorative arts, photography and video, from ancient times to the present. Presented by the Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community, it covers work from numerous Native American regions. Minneapolis Institute of Art, 2400 Third Avenue South, 888-642-2787, artsmia.org

BARCELONA, SPAIN
“The Meet Vincent van Gogh Experience”
Through June 2

It opens in the wheat field northwest of Paris where van Gogh fatally shot himself (or did someone else do it?) in 1890. Visitors feel the breeze and hear the crows scattering skyward after the gunshot. This traveling 3-D show, created by the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, includes life-size projections and all manner of multimedia interactivity, bringing to life the artist and the people and places in his world. Port Vell, 011-31-20-216-06-04, meetvincent.com
LONDON
“Don McCullin”
Through May 6

Mr. McCullin (Sir Donald to his countrymen), 83, is best known for his war photography, including Vietnam and Syria, but this main-floor retrospective also presents his depictions of subjects closer to home. More than 250 photos, all printed by the photographer, include scenes of urban poverty and political demonstrations. Tate Britain, Millbank, 011-44-20-7887-8888, tate.org.uk
PARIS
“Prehistory”
May 8-Sept. 16

Inspired by something as primitive as prehistoric sculpture? It was good enough for Picasso, Cézanne, Giacometti and many others. This show places art from the last century or so right next to Paleolithic and Neolithic works. Centre Pompidou, Place Georges Pompidou, 011-33-1-44-78-12-33, centrepompidou.fr
